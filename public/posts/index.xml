<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a simple exploratory analysis about the prescriptions of antidepressants in the UK. The data was freely obtained from the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/prescriptions-of-antidepressants" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/prescriptions-of-antidepressants</a>, where more information about the specifics can be found.</p>

<h3>Notes about the data</h3>
<p>Before progressing further, there are a couple of points that need to be noted about the data:</p>
<p>1). As it is not possible to capture all information perfectly, some data can be missing. In this case, it is within the Age.Band variable, where the patients age is placed within groups. Where information was presumably lost or mislabeled, the age group “Nov-17” has been created. This is a very minor part of the data, and is filtered out at some charts as it is not going to have any impact on the analysis.</p>
<p>2). Regarding the practises, some are labelled as “Non-CCG prescriber”, implying that these practises are not part of the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) in the UK. Later in the analysis, in some charts this will be accounted for and in others it will not. This will depend on the specific chart and will be explained.</p>

<p>The Country variable only has England as its observation, and the Drug.Group variable is only antidepressants (logically). Therefore, to make the data more neat, these variables can be removed as they don’t contribute anything. There is a difference between Practice.Code and Practice.Name, implying that a practice may have more than one code. The geographic variables of this data are hierarchical in nature, with Region being at the highest level and Practice.Code being the lowest. The first and the last two variables are also renamed to make them more clear. Finally, a check for the existence of any missing values is run as well.</p>

<p>Both the number of patients and the number of prescriptions have been gradually increasing throughout the 3 year period, which can be naturally expected. An interesting point to note is the massive difference between the number of patients and the number of prescriptions, which will be explored later. There isn’t enough data to confidently comment on any trends with time as 3 years is not enough to make any strong forecasts.</p>

<p>The largest number of patients prescribed to anti-depressants are above the age of 40, which is more than half of the total number of patients present within the data. The lowest number, at just about 6000 is for children between the age of 0 and 10. It should be noted that these number of patients are derived from capturing the unique NHS number present on the prescriptions, implying that each patient is recieving a prescription for some kind of antidepressant. Similarly, the number of prescriptions per age group is visualized below.</p>

<p>The overall trend is the same in this chart as compared to the previous one, the only difference being that while the highest number of patients are between 40-59, the highest number of prescriptions are for the group 60 plus.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there is a quite a large numerical difference between the number of patients and the number of prescriptions for each age group. A ratio of the two variables can be insightful as it can provide an approximate estimate about the number of prescriptions per patients. However, it should not be assumed that this value is consistent, as the prescriptions in reality will depend on each specific patients case.</p>

<p>As expected, the number of prescriptions per patient is consistently rising as the age group increases as well, nearing almost 10 prescriptions per patient at the 60 plus age group.</p>

<h3>Diving deeper</h3>
<p>To further understand the data, it can be useful to consider how the number of patients and prescriptions vary with the geographic variables. Below is a Cleveland Plot to visualize both these key variables per practise name. As there are over 8000 practise names, this plot will be a bit cluttered, but can still provide some useful insights, while also maintaining an interesting aesthetic.</p>

<p>The above plot provides some key insights. The number of patients (blue dots) appear to be reltively uniformly distributed throughout (however this may be a bit misleading due to scaling). More importantly however, there is a massive outlier created by the Non-CCG prescriber practises. A potential reason for this is that every practise that is not a CCG prescriber is given the exact same label, and therefore all these practises are assumed to one, with their patients and prescriptions being summed together. This is shown in the following table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>subset(practise, Practice.Name == &#39;Non-CCG prescriber&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   Practice.Name      Number.of.Patients Number.of.Prescriptions
##   &lt;fct&gt;                           &lt;int&gt;                   &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Non-CCG prescriber             309859                  660146</code></pre>
<p>These are 18 in number from the total observations. In the following plot, the Non-CCG prescriber label is filtered out to provide a more clear image.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#remove Non-CCG prescriber label

<p>This plot now provides a slightly clearer image. There is apparently quite a lot of variance in the number of prescriptions per practice (black dots), compared to the number of patients. To highlight some outliers, the practices which have more than 20000 patients and provide over 150000 prescriptions have also been labeled. These plots can go into another level of detail (down the hierarchy) by replacing practise names with the practise codes. However this runs the risk of being even more cluttered, and finding anything related to a specific practise without applying some filters will be difficult. Business intelligence software (Power BI or Tableau for example) can be useful in such cases.</p>
<p>A final look can be given to how the number of patients and prescriptions vary with both the Region and CCG. A treemap is particularly useful to plot such hierarchical data. Before plotting however, the Non-CCG prescriber labels are removed from the entire dataset, as the way they are labelled is such that if a practise is not a CCG prescriber, then the region, ccg and practise name variables are all given the same label. This is will not process properly through the treemap as it can’t be determined whether this is just one practise or several, and is therefore removed. The number of such observations are relatively small, and should not impact the overall analysis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filter non-ccg prescriber
AD &lt;- subset(AD, Practice.Name != &#39;Non-CCG prescriber&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The treemaps for both the number of patients and the number of prescriptions are plotted below, and both show overall the same pattern as seen in the previous plots (comparing with age group), with darker regions indicating a higher number for each variable. This makes sense since where there are more patients it is likely there are more prescriptions as well.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>While traditional time series models such as the Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA families are perfectly capable of making sound forecasts, there are some instances where such models are unable to fully capture what the data is portraying. In such cases, especially where the highest predictive power is required and favoured over model interpretability, advanced machine learning methods can be useful. In this analysis, the daily prices of Brent Oil(20th May 1987 - 21st April 2020) are going to be examined. The models used are the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The goal is to test each of these models to determine which of these produces the lowest error metric, and is therefore the most accurate. The “h2o” package in R will be used in this case. The data was freely obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mabusalah/brent-oil-prices" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/mabusalah/brent-oil-prices</a></p>
<p>Loading the libraries and data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(forecast)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(timeDate)
#Data
Oil_Price &lt;- read.csv(&quot;BrentOilPrices.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The h2o package will be initialized later.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-preprocessing" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Before moving onwards to exploration and modelling, some simple data processing needs to be done. Specifically in this case, only the dates need to be converted into a consistent format. The following chunk of code accomplishes this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Oil_Price_1 &lt;- Oil_Price[1:8322,]
Oil_Price_1$Date &lt;- as.Date(Oil_Price_1$Date, format = &quot;%d-%b-%y&quot;)

Oil_Price_2 &lt;- Oil_Price[8323:8360, ]
Oil_Price_2$Date &lt;- as.Date(Oil_Price_2$Date, format = &quot;%b %d, %Y&quot;)

Oil_Price_df &lt;- rbind(Oil_Price_1, Oil_Price_2) #final clean dataframe

rm(Oil_Price_1)#remove uneccessary data
rm(Oil_Price_2)#remove uneccessary data
rm(Oil_Price)#remove uneccessary data</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="visualizing-and-exploring" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing and Exploring</h3>
<p>To begin exploring, a standard line chart is often a good place to start to get a general overview of the progression of prices with time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#standard line chart (interactive)
ggplotly(ggplot(Oil_Price_df, aes(Date, Price)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = &quot;1 year&quot;, date_labels = &quot;%Y&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1))) </code></pre>

<p>A density plot for each month will show if there are any obvious seasonal effects present. From the plot below, there does not seem to be any seasonality present in the data, with the distributions for each month appearing almost exactly the same year by year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>OP_df &lt;- Oil_Price_df
OP_df$Month &lt;- factor(month.abb[month(OP_df$Date)], levels = month.abb)
OP_df$Year &lt;- year(OP_df$Date) #creating new temporary df for additional plots

ggplot(OP_df, aes(Price)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Month)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(as.factor(Month)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Brent-Oil_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>A box plot can be used to visualize the yearly distribution of oil prices:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(OP_df, aes(Price, fill = Year)) +
  geom_boxplot(xlab = &quot;&quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(as.factor(Year))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Brent-Oil_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>rm(OP_df) #remove temporary data</code></pre>
<p>The progression of the box plot above is naturally similar to the line charts plotted earlier. However, an intersting insight is how it shows a greater increase in price variance during periods of economic crises, notably in 2008 and early 2020. Apart from this, there are no other cyclical, seasonal or trend patterns observed. Finally, the autocorrelation between prices can be seen from the Partial ACF plot. The PACF is used as it is slightly better than a standard ACF plot since the PACF provides an estimate of a direct correlation with a series lag after removing any correlation with previous lags.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pacf &lt;- pacf(Oil_Price_df$Price, plot = FALSE)
plot(pacf, main = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Brent-Oil_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The PACF above shows a very significant correlation of the series with only its first lag. Given the insights generated from the exploration above, it can be concluded that the oil price series does not follow any typical pattern or trends that one might find in a time series data, thus making the forecasting problem slightly more complex. In such cases, maybe employing ML models to do the heavy lifting may be the logical way to go, which will be shown in the next phase.</p>

<div id="modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>To generate forecasts for oil prices, the relationship of the series with its own lagged values is going to be analysed. This is implying (for the sake of this analysis) that there are no other factors impacting prices other than its own lagged value at different stages. Therefore, lagged values of the oil prices are generated and added to the data frame at lag1, lag5, lag22, lag130 and lag260. This corresponds to the daily, weekly, monthly, half-yearly and yearly lags. Observe that the number of days is slightly different than what may normally be seen as there are no price values on the weekend, so the weekend days are not present. Also it is assumed for simplicity that there are no leap years. The cost of inserting these lags is losing values for 1 year, which is alright in this case as there are several years of data available.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Oil_Price_df &lt;- Oil_Price_df %&gt;%
  mutate(lag1 = lag(Price, n = 1),#daily
         lag5 = lag(Price, n = 5),#weekly
         lag22 = lag(Price, n = 22),#monthly
         lag130 = lag(Price, n = 130),#half yearly
         lag260 = lag(Price, n = 260))#yearly

Oil_Price_df &lt;- na.omit(Oil_Price_df) #left with 8100 rows (so minus 1 year)</code></pre>
<p>The data is split into training and testing partitions, with the last one year accounting for the testing period. It should be noted that unlike normal data splitting, time series needs to be split in order as the the series progression must remain intact.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>h &lt;- 260
train_OP &lt;- Oil_Price_df[1:(nrow(Oil_Price_df) - h), ]
test_OP &lt;- Oil_Price_df[(nrow(Oil_Price_df) - h + 1):nrow(Oil_Price_df), ]</code></pre>
<p>To begin modelling, h2o needs to be initialized.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(h2o)

h2o.init(max_mem_size = &quot;16G&quot;)

train_OPh &lt;- as.h2o(train_OP)
test_OPh &lt;- as.h2o(test_OP)

x &lt;- c(&quot;lag1&quot;, &quot;lag5&quot;, &quot;lag22&quot;, &quot;lag130&quot;, &quot;lag260&quot;)
y &lt;- &quot;Price&quot; #x and y defined only to make it easier to type </code></pre>
<p>The first model, and also the benchmark model, is the GLM. The GLM is suitable as a benchmark in this case because even though it is the simplest out of all the choices, it is still flexible enough to allow for data that doesnt strictly follow normal distributions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glm_OP &lt;- h2o.glm(family = &quot;gaussian&quot;,
                  x = x,
                  y = y, 
                  training_frame = train_OPh)
test_OPh$pred_glmOP &lt;- h2o.predict(glm_OP, test_OPh)</code></pre>
<p>Once the above model is run, the error metrics can be calculated based on how the model performs on the test data. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is being used as the metric in this case. The MAPE is often used as it provides a percentage value which is fairly easy to interpret.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_OP_df &lt;- as.data.frame(test_OPh)
test_OP_df$Date &lt;- test_OP$Date

mape_glmOP &lt;- mean(abs(test_OP_df$Price - test_OP_df$pred_glmOP) / 
                     test_OP_df$Price)
mape_glmOP * 100</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6.940597</code></pre>
<p>The MAPE value is observed for the GLM method. While on its own not much can be said about this value, it is now going to be set as a benchmark for future models. A plot is also drawn to visualize the fitting capabilities of the GLMs predicted values against the actual test series. It can be seen that the GLM does manage to capture the general direction the series is in.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_ly(data = test_OP_df) %&gt;%
  add_lines(x = ~ Date, y = ~Price, name = &quot;Actual&quot;) %&gt;%
  add_lines(x = ~ Date, y = ~ pred_glmOP, 
            name = &quot;GLM&quot;, 
            line = list(dash = &quot;dot&quot;))  %&gt;%

<p>The next model to be tested is the Random Forest model. The parameters are set to be fairly reasonable, with 5000 trees being created at a maximum depth of 10, with a 10-fold cross-validation process to maximize accuracy. The depth and number of trees can be set higher, but this comes at the cost of potential overfitting and high computing power requirements.</p>

<p>An interesting observation from the above visual is that the RF model seems to be performing simarly to the GLM until the major dips in price from Jan 2020, meaning the RF model is probably not capturing the extreme deviance from the average price level very well. Maybe more advanced models can be successful.</p>
<p>The GBM is the next model that is used. It can be considered as an improved version of Random Forests, as it aims to learn from its mistakes and build better trees (the boosting aspect). Again, 10-fold cross-validation is used as the parameter.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 3.137452</code></pre>
<p>The MAPE value from the GBM shows a major improvement over both the GLM and RF. This means the GBM (without any hyperparameter tuning) is quite capable of forecasting the prices reasonably well. From the visualization it is apparent that the improvement can be attributed to the GBMs ability to fit the extreme dip quite well.</p>

<p>The final model to be tested is the Deep Neural Network. This utilises a neural network with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. The higher number of layers increases complexity and along with it the accuracy as well. A small sized 3 hidden layer network is used with 16, 8 and 4 nodes in the first, second and third layers respectively, with 50 epochs (50 repititions).</p>

<p>The MAPE value for the DNN is not as good as the GBM metric, so in this particular case, the GBM produces the most accurate results. However, the difference between the two is not too significant. The fitted plot shows that the GBM and DNN are performing fairly equally, with both successfully capturing the extreme dip.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The results on the face of it do imply that the GBM is producing the best results. However, these are very basic implementations of the models, and with hyperparameter tuning via grid searches, the results can improve and perhaps the DNN may perform better in that case. It can also be worthwhile to utilise feature importance to improve results. An example can be what features does the GBM believe are important for forecasting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>h2o.varimp_plot(GBM_OP)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Brent-Oil_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The above plot shows that the GBM only considers the daily lagged value to be of any relevance for predictions. This can be contrasted with the feature importance plot of the DNN.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>h2o.varimp_plot(DNN_OP)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Brent-Oil_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>In this case, the DNN considers all the lags to be of reasonable importance, with the highest importance still being granted to the daily lag. The point being made here is that by using feature importance as a tool, multiple iterations of the modelling process can be run, combining feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to arrive at the most accurate predictive model.</p>

<h3>Visualizing and Exploring</h3>
<p>Before progressing forward, it may be helpful to list all the questions as a quick reference if required. The 54 questions are as follows:</p>

</ol>
<p>As all the answers are categorical by nature (a single value between 0 and 4), the variables need to be converted to a factor first before moving forward with the analysis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>divorce[,1:55] &lt;- lapply(divorce[,1:55], factor) # convert all to factor
colnames(divorce)[55] &lt;- &quot;Status&quot; #change dependent variable name

summary(divorce$Status) #a summary of the dependent variable</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  0  1 
## 86 84</code></pre>
<p>From the summary values above, it is clear that the two classes (1 and 0) are almost equal in quantity, therefore there is no class imbalance problem. This luckily makes the analysis simpler to perform.</p>
<p>To further understand the independent variables, a correlation plot is developed to see if any of the questions provide approximately the same information to the data. It should be noted that with categorical data, it is better to use chi-square test or Cramer’s V to measure the strength of association between the variables. However, this is a special case where the variables are rank ordered, or in other words, the categorical variables are ordinal, making it suitable to use the Spearman’s correlation coefficient.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>divorce_num &lt;- divorce[,1:54] #temporary dataframe created
divorce_num[,1:54] &lt;- sapply(divorce_num[,1:54], as.numeric) #reconverting back to numeric 
#for the correlation function to work

div_cor &lt;- cor(divorce_num, method = &quot;spearman&quot;)
corrplot(div_cor, method = &quot;shade&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Divorce_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>The correlation plot does provide some interesting insights. Questions 6 and 7 have very little to no correlation with any of the other questions. There are also certain chunks of questions that apparently have a higher correlation with each other than the general average, such as from Question 8 to 30. However, the overall high correlations are not that surprising, as the questions all do have a central theme of marriage and relationships in common, so in some way it is plausible to assume they will all be interlinked with each other in some way. Despite this, some extremely high correlated questions can be removed to get rid of any redundant features.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>findCorrelation(div_cor,
                cutoff = 0.95,
                names = TRUE) #finding questions that have a correlation of 0.95 or higher. </code></pre>
<pre><code>## character(0)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>divorce &lt;- divorce[,c(-19, -36)]</code></pre>
<p>Questions 19, 36 and 20 are highly correlated with each other, so 19 and 36 are removed, leaving 20 (a personal choice). To conclude visualizing, the class distribution of the dependent variable can also be plotted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Visualizing class distribution of dependent variable...

<p>As previously mentioned, the number of married and divorced couples answering the questions is almost equally balanced.</p>

<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>As this is a simple binary classifaction problem (only two outcomes), the interpretability of the process is not too complicated. The data is partitioned using a 70/30 train-test split, and a 10-fold repeated cross validation resampling strategy is applied. The models used for classification predictions are Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (Logi), Generalized Linear Model with Regularization Parameters (RGZ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). To sccuinctly and briefly describe the methods: NB uses probabilistic theory based on Bayes Theorum to classify variables, Logi is a log transformed version of the standard linear regression model making it suitable for classification as opposed to regression, RGZ is version of generalized linear models involving penalty parameters aimed to improve performance when there are numerous feaures involved, and SVM is an advanced technique where features classified on a simulated feature by a specific function utilising linear algebra techniques.</p>
<p>The goal is to find the best model among these four that produces the most accurate predictions. Along with the standard accuracy metric used in the confusion matrices in classification problem, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve will also be utilised, since it provides a more robust validation of the accuracy. It should be noted however, that in cases of binary classifactions, the area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC and the accuracy values are the same. The data is split and the models are run in the following code block.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Train-Test Split...

<p>To compare the accuracy of the models on the training set, both the accuracy and the Kappa values are compared. The Kappa value is thought to be more robust as it takes into account the success of the predictions based solely on chance.</p>

<p>The top table highlights the accuracy values, while the bottom table highlights the Kappa values. In both cases, the Naive Bayes (benchmark model) performed the worst, with SVM performing the best. However, the RGZ Model is also very close, which warrants further inspection. It is also highly possible that the SVM due to its complexity may be overfitting. The next step is to analyse the confusion matrices for each of the models. The “positive” class in this case is 1 (divorce).</p>

<p>Once again, the Naive Bayes model produces the worst results. However, this time the RGZ model and the SVM model have performed exactly the same, with equal accuracy, Kappa and confusion matrix values. This allows for the possibility of actually choosing the RGZ model instead of the SVM, as they are both performing equally, and the RGZ model is preferable as it is much easier to interpret. However, just to be sure, the AUC values for the models can be computed as well.</p>

The curve for RGZ resembles an almost perfect ROC curve, which is backed up by the exceptionally high accuracy.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The following analysis utilises data comprising of cocaine prices available on an online hidden marketplace called Dream Market, available on the deep web. This data was freely obtained at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/everling/cocaine-listings" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/everling/cocaine-listings</a>, with further details about the data available in the description. As the title might suggest, the goal of this analysis is attempting to accurately predict the cocaine prices based on the variables provided, utlising the Random Forests (RF) method. The RF model combines several weak learners (individual decision trees) to form a single strong ensemble model. The RF method is chosen simply because it is flexible enough to incorporate various kinds of data, and has the ability to provide a low level of bias along with a moderate level of variance, a balance that is often hard to achieve in ML models. The analysis is kept as simple as possible, without any significant complications.</p>

<div id="visualizing-and-exploring" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing and Exploring</h3>
<p>At first sight, the data may seem somewhat complicated due to the large number of variables (64 in total). However, a vast majority of these are only catergorical, highlighting whether the product was shipped to or from a certain region. Other important variables include grams sold, the cost per gram, the quality of the product, escrow (whether a third party was involved for transaction security), successful transactions by the vendor and the customer ratings given. As cost per gram is the target variable in this analysis, exploration can begin from here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># distribution of cost per gram...
ggplot(cocaine, aes(cost_per_gram)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(cost_per_gram, ..density..),fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;,
                 color = &quot;black&quot;, bins = 40) +
  geom_density(size = 1.25) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Cocaine-Prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The histogram of the cost per gram variable shows a right skewed distribution. The prices are listed in Bitcoin currency. Majority of the prices fall below 0.05 BTC, which implies that there is some homogeneity involved in how closely the prices listed by various vendors are similar to each other. The cocaine market is apparently more competitive than one would think.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#avg ratings...
ggplot(cocaine, aes(rating)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Cocaine-Prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The ratings of cocaine being sold is quite high, with no product being rated less than 4.4/5. Majority of the ratings are between 4.8 and 5, implying strong customer satisfaction from the product, and also a left skewed distribution. The 4.4 rating can also be considered an outlier if compared with how the other ratings are distributed. Perhaps there were problems with delivery, or the batch wasnt as high quality as usual, or some other factors were involved.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#scatter plot for quality vs cost_per gram (interactive)
ggplotly(ggplot(cocaine, aes(quality, cost_per_gram)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal())</code></pre>

<p>While the initial impression may be that costs and quality should be directly proportional with each other (a rise in quality increases price), the plot above shows that this is not strictly true. A clear linear relationship cannot be observed, and for a certain measure of quality, there are numerous prices being quoted. This can be seen especially for products with quality quoted at 90 having numerous prices. It can be concluded that there are probably some other factors strongly involved apart from quality that are determining the cost per gram of the product.</p>

<p>To understand the relationship between location and prices, the data is gathered and reordered according to where the product is shipped from and where it is shipped to. The former is plotted above, providing some interesting insights. The highest quality product is shipped from China, which also surprisingly involves the lowest average price. This is opposite in Australia, where the lowest quality (87 can be considered quite low quality in terms of cocaine) is being shipped from but also involves the highest average price.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#interaction between price and ships_to, including quality...

<p><img src="/posts/Cocaine-Prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Regarding the relationship with where the product is being shipped to, once again Australia (and this time New Zealand as well) stands out right at front for having the highest average price along with the lowest quality. This can warrant further specialized study as to whether there is a reason behind this strange Australian phenomena, or if it’s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Before progressing towards the modelling stage, the data needs to be cleaned up a bit by removing some unwanted variables. This is done by the following code chunk:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cocaine &lt;- cocaine[, c(-1:-3, -6, -8, -10:-13, -15, -16)] #removing unwanted variables
cocaine[,4] &lt;- as.factor(cocaine[,4]) #converting escrow to a factor as it is a categorical variable, not numeric</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>To begin modelling, first the data needs to be split into training and testing partitions, along with some feature engineering to make the data more suitable for the models. The data is normalized to fix the skewness problems observed earlier, and standardised to fix and range issues. All categorical variables are also dummy encoded. It should be noted that the total modelling process takes a while to run due to applying grid searches.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
split &lt;- initial_split(cocaine, prop = 0.7) #splitting the data by 70/30 train test split
train_cc &lt;- training(split)
test_cc &lt;- testing(split)

cc_recipe &lt;- recipe(cost_per_gram ~ ., data = train_cc)

cc_recipe_steps &lt;- cc_recipe %&gt;%
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %&gt;% #applying normlazing to fix skewness 
  step_center(all_numeric()) %&gt;% #standardise values
  step_scale(all_numeric()) %&gt;% #standardise values
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = FALSE) #convert all nominal to dummy

cc_recipe_prep &lt;- prep(cc_recipe_steps, training = train_cc)

train_cc_rp &lt;- bake(cc_recipe_prep, train_cc)
test_cc_rp &lt;- bake(cc_recipe_prep, test_cc)</code></pre>
<p>Having completed the feature engineering process, the first model is run. The KNN model is used only to serve as a benchmark for performance comparisons with the RF models to be run later on. Also, the resampling technique is defined as a 10-fold repeated cross-validation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Using repeated cross-validation...

<p>The KNN model output shows that the optimal number of K neighbours was determined to be 5 which minimises the RMSE. The R squared seems to be good, but since this is just a benchmark, it needs to be compared with other values to be verified.</p>
<p>Having run the benchmark, it is time to run the RF model. A grid search is used, using 4 different values of the parameter mtry. The mtry is defined as the number of variables available for the decision tree to split at each tree node. Since there are a significant number of variables involved, the mtry value is a useful parameter to tune to maximise the predictive power of the model. The ideal mtry value as per standard theory should be 17 (53/3), so a range of mtry values from 15 to 20 are selected to account for this. The code below runs the RF model.</p>

<p>The results of the RF model show that an mtry value of 19 provides the lowest RMSE, along with a higher R squared. These are both significant improvements over the benchmark KNN model. The performance of all mtry values can be visualised by the following plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(rf_cc)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Cocaine-Prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The results however have the potential for further improvement. As there are numerous variables involved, there is scope of performing feature selection to significantly reduce the number of variables involved in order to improve accuracy. The following plot highlights the important variables as determined by the RF model, which will then be selected to run another iteration. Not surprisingly, grams is the most important for calculating cost_per_gram. It should be noted however that due to random sampling the list below might change. However, after running a few iterations, it was determined that from the top 20, about 17-18 variables remained in the top 20 consistently. Therefore, there should not be a significant difference in results.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above analysis attempts to utilise the RF model to accurately predict cocaine prices based on the several features available. While performing feature selection and fine tuning the model is generally a good idea, care must be used to ensure that the successful accuracy metrics are not infact subject to overfitting, as seen above. If achieving solely the highest predictive performance was the goal here, then other predictive models could be utilised in a similar fashion, by using different iterations and applying feature engineering methods.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This analysis involves a simple prediction problem. The dataset has been designed for basic data analysis, and is suitable for applying introductory predictive methods. The goal is to simply gain an understanding into the analytical process using two basic predictive models: Linear Regression and Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).</p>
<p>The dataset contains some information about computers, with the dependant variable in this case being price, and other features including speed, RAM, screen etc. The data is freely avaibale from this link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/basic-computer-data-set" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/basic-computer-data-set</a></p>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The next step before jumping into the analysis is to clean up the data a bit and fix any potential issues that may arise. Doing this requires some initial exploring.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(computers) #indicating the data type for each variable</code></pre>

<p>There are a few things that can be done to make this analysis a bit more simple. Some unnecessary features are removed, since there is no clear description about what these features actually mean with regards to computer pricing. This is more of an arbitrary judgement in this case. The features being removed are “X”, “ads”, and “trend”. Alongside this, the features “speed”, “ram” and “screen” are converted from integer to factor types as these variables are actually categorical instead of simple numerical values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean &lt;- computers[, -1] #removing X

computers.clean$ram &lt;- as.factor(computers.clean$ram)
computers.clean$screen &lt;- as.factor(computers.clean$screen)</code></pre>
<p>A glimpse of the data can be helpful.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(computers.clean)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   price speed  hd ram screen cd multi premium

<p>It is also useful to convert the characters “yes” and “no” into 1 and 0 numbers respectively. While some predictive models do not require this conversion, other more simple methods do need numeric values. Therefore it is better to simply convert such variables to numeric, as opposed to risking an error.</p>

<div id="visualizing-and-exploring" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing and Exploring</h3>
<p>Following the preprocessing stage, the next step in this analysis is to visualize the features. This will provide any insights about the specific distributions and other aspects about the nature of each feature. As the dataset is quite simple, there is no expectation that any complicated insight will be generated. Still, it is useful to get a visual perspective.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  theme_minimal() #histogram for Price</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() #boxplot for Price</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Initial impressions of the histogram indicate a right-skewed distribution for computer prices. This is confirmed by the presence of some outliers indicated by high-priced computers. The outliers can be visualized by the boxplot. While generally it is recommended to transform the dependent variable in order to reduce skewness, here it is ignored as firstly it is really not that severe, and for the purpose of this exercise it is not necessary to strictly ensure Gaussian distributions as this is more about describing the process of analysis, as opposed to analytical accuracy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = hd)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) + 
  theme_minimal() #historgram for HD</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = hd)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() #boxplot for HD</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Similarly skewed distributions and outliers are observed for the HD variable as well. As RAM and Screen are categorical variables, simple bar plots can be used to visualize them. A useful insight into these variables is the imbalanced count between them, with large RAM and Screen size accounting for a small proportion of the data. This can be a problem for predictive models, especially with small sample sizes such as this data, as there are not enough observations for the model to provide a robust prediction at these specific categories. This problem can be solved by random sampling techniques.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = ram)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = ram)) +
  theme_minimal() #bar plot for RAM</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>computers.clean %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = screen)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = screen)) +
  theme_minimal() #bar plot for screen size</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Computers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Finally, proportion tables can also be used to visualize and understand the remaining variables; premium, multi and cd. Disproportionate categories can be seen in the Premium and Multi variables as well, while CD remains somewhat balanced.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(computers.clean$premium)) * 100</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##        0        1 
##  9.77792 90.22208</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(computers.clean$multi)) * 100</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##        0        1

<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(computers.clean$cd)) * 100</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##       0       1 
## 53.5389 46.4611</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>Having completed the visualizing and exploring phase, the next step is the actual modelling. For this analysis, two models are being used, as mentioned earlier. The simple Linear Regression Model will first be applied, serving as the benchmark performer. Following this, the MARS model will be applied to observe if there is any improvement in accuracy.</p>
<p>Before moving on to the actual models, the data first needs to be split into training and testing partitions. A 65/35 split is used here, as the data size is small and this split reserves a fair portion for testing to avoid overfitting models.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
split &lt;- initial_split(computers.clean, prop = 0.65)
comp_train &lt;- training(split) #4069 rows
comp_test &lt;- testing(split) #2190 rows</code></pre>
<p>The next step is choosing a resampling strategy. Repeated cross-validation generally works quite well to improve accuracy and performance. However, on very large datasets this will obviously be more computationally taxing than regular cross-validation or bootstrapping.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cv &lt;- trainControl(
  method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;,
  number = 20,
  repeats = 10
) #20-fold cross validation with 10 repititions. Seems a bit overkill but it&#39;s okay. </code></pre>
<p>The modelling process can now begin. The caret() package is being used for model training and testing. Below is the Linear Model being implemented:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
comp_model_lm &lt;- train(form = price ~ .,
                     data = comp_train,
                     method = &quot;lm&quot;,
                     trControl = cv) 

comp_model_lm #Linear Model</code></pre>

<p>Initial impressions of the LM model state that the model performed somewhat average. The R-square is nothing spectacular. As this is simply a benchmark model, the RMSE value and R square will be used as a comparison with future model performances.</p>
<p>The next step is applying the MARS model. This model may work better than the standard linear model if there is a lack of a strictly linear relationship between the predictors and the dependant variable. A basic implementation of the MARS model is being applied here, without any hyperparameter tuning or grid searches. This will utilise default values for interaction complexity (degree) and find the number of terms to retain (nprune). It should be noted that the number of degrees selected is very unlikely to be above 3 as there tends to be very little benefit in performance beyond this number.</p>

<p>The three metrics used to compare the two models are the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R-squared and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). Generally the RMSE is used more frequently as it penalizes larger errors more than the MAE, but in this case all three are used.</p>

<p>It can be seen that the average RMSE and MAE are both lower for the MARS model as opposed to the Linear Model. The average R-square for the MARS model is also higher. However, it should be noted that these differences are very marginal. Also, these tests are done on the training sets, and the metrics need to be calculated on the testing partition as well to assess whether there was any overfitting.</p>

<p>The above results again indicate that the MARS model performs better, yet still only being a marginal improvement. It is also a good indication that there is no significant overfitting, as the RMSE and R-square values are fairly close to each other for both training and testing sets.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above analysis can be considered a simplified version of the analytical process, starting from data cleaning and processing, moving on to visualizing and exploration and ending at the modelling phase. From the modelling phase, it was determined that the MARS model performs better at predicting the computer prices. However, this result should not be taken for granted, at least not without any further exploration. It was seen that some features of the data were skewed, and training models on such skewed data without correcting for this can lead to unreliable testing results, especially in models such as the simple Linear Model. Along with this, feature testing can also be conducted to determine which features are more important for the predictions. Also, it is useful to run numerous iterations of the models, specifically with hyperparameter tuning as this tends to produce more accurate results.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a simple analysis examining how variables interacting with each other can impact regression performance. The data set has only nine features, out of which there will be further feature selection, thereby making it easy to understand the effects. The data was freely obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/steveahn/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/steveahn/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data</a>. It describes the results of an experiment which observes the effects of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall, while simultaneously including the effect of happy and sad memories. Three different drugs were used, along with three different levels of dosage. The results (in seconds) of how long it took to finish a memory test before drug exposure and after being exposed are noted in two separate columns, with the difference between these two noted separately. The difference is the target variable in this case. The age of the participants are also considered. The analysis is focused on being as simple as possible, as the primary goal is examining how results change when the interaction between variables is taken into account. More information regarding the data can be found in the provided link.</p>

<h3>Processing and Exploring</h3>
<p>Before moving forward, the data needs to be processed slightly to simplify a few things. The columns containing first and last names are removed, as they are not necessarily required for this analysis. Also, Dosage needs to be converted to type factor as this is actually a categorical variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>memory &lt;- memory[, -1:-2] #removing columns with names
memory[, 3] &lt;- as.factor(memory[, 3]) #converting Dosage to factor</code></pre>
<p>Firstly, the distributions of the age variable can be visualised to see how spread out the different ages of the participants are. The age distribution is right skewed, with majority of the participants falling between the ages 25 and 40. It is noteworthy that there is only one person who is 24 years old.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>seqage &lt;- as.vector(memory[, 1]) #create temporary vector for the visual

#age distribution
ggplotly(ggplot(memory, aes(age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seqage) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,20, by = 1)) +

<p>To further examine the variables, the relationship between the age variables and the memory scores are plotted below. Firstly, the skewness in the score variables is fairly negligible. There is also a high correlation between the before and after scores, but perhaps that is because the difference between them is only marginal. These variables will not be used in the modelling process anyway. Apart from that, there is very little correlation seen between age and the scores, implying that perhaps age does not have much of an impact on memory recall in this specific experiment.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>rm(mem_num) #remove temporary dataframe</code></pre>
<p>A quick glimpse at the proportions of the categorical variables (Drugs, Dosage, Happy_Sad_group) can provide insights into how balanced the data is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(memory[,2])) * 100 #happy / sad memory primer</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  H  S 
## 50 50</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>prop.table(table(memory[,3])) * 100 #dosage levels</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## 33.83838 33.33333 32.82828</code></pre>
<p>It can be seen that the categorical variables are all almost equally proportional, indicating that the data in this regard is very well balanced. Moving on to the main aspect of this analysis, the interactions between the aforementioned variables needs to be observed. Acknowledging the presence of interactions amongst variables is important in statistical analysis as when they are not accounted for, the modelling results will be inaccurate since the model is unable to capture the specific relationship between the variables. To check for interactions, interaction plots are developed to identify any relationships between the three categorical variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>interaction.plot(memory$Drug, memory$Dosage, memory$Diff, 
                 xlab = &quot;Drug&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mean of Diff&quot;,trace.label = &quot;Dosage&quot;) #Drug-Dosage</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Drugs-and-Memories_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>interaction.plot(memory$Dosage, memory$Happy_Sad_group, memory$Diff,
                 xlab = &quot;Dosage&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mean of Diff&quot;,trace.label = &quot;Happy_Sad&quot;) #Dosage - Happy_Sad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Drugs-and-Memories_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>interaction.plot(memory$Drug, memory$Happy_Sad_group, memory$Diff, 
                 xlab = &quot;Drug&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mean of Diff&quot;,trace.label = &quot;Happy_Sad&quot;) #Drug - Happy_Sad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Drugs-and-Memories_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>From the plots above, interaction is observed between the Drug and Dosage variables. This needs to be accounted for in the modelling process to provide accurate results. Before moving to the modelling stage, the before and after scores are removed as these are not necessary for the analysis and are already accounted for in the Diff variable.</p>

<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>The modelling phase begins with partitioning the data into a 70/30 train-test split. The resampling method is also defined as 10-fold repeated cross validation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
split &lt;- initial_split(memory, prop = 0.7)

<p>To provide a benchmark, a simple Linear Model is used, without accounting for the interaction effects, to see how the model initially performs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)

<p>The simple linear model produces an R-squared which is not particularly impressive. To test if a more advanced model is able to do better, the Bagging method is used, implementing several decision trees and aggregating their results. It basically implements an ensemble approach. It may seem overkill for the purpose of this analysis, but this is only to compare how much a highly advanced model can improve performance.</p>

<p>The R-squared for the Bagged model is much better, but it is still a bit unimpressive. In the next iteration, the interaction effect will be accounted for by adding "Drug*Dosage" to the list of independent variables. This is demonstrated below by the simple LM model.</p>

<p>An improvement in the R-squared value as compared to the previous LM implementation is observed. The RMSE has also slightly lowered.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above results have clearly indicated that accounting for interaction is essential in the regression process, as their influence can significantly impact how the model performs. While it may have been slightly intuitive that the drugs and their dosage are related with each other, it is still worthwhile to check for interactions if the model is performing unexpectedly poorly, or there is a suspicion about interactions based on an understanding of the data. The above results can then be further improved with more thorough modelling techniques. An example can be assessing the importance of the features. The feature importance plot according to the first LM model is shown below as an example.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project attempts to classify whether a patient is suffering from an epileptic seizure or not based on certain known features. The dataset was freely obtained from the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/epileptic-seizure-recognition" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/epileptic-seizure-recognition</a>. To summarise the data, the features comprise of individual data points of an EEG recording, monitoring a subject’s brain activity at different points in time. Further details about the specifications of these variables can be found via the given link. The data consists of 178 explanatory variables, labeled X1, X2,……,X178, and the target variable is simply called y. The target variable comprises of 5 classes, highlighting the following information:</p>
<p>5 - eyes open, meaning when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open</p>
<p>4 - eyes closed, meaning when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed</p>
<p>3 - they identified where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recorded the EEG activity from the healthy brain area</p>
<p>2 - they recorded the EEG from the area where the tumor was located</p>
<p>1 - recording of seizure activity</p>
<p>To summarise, only class 1 indicates any presence of seizures, while the other 4 classes can be considered as the absence of seizures. With 178 features, there are 11500 rows of information, making this a reasonable sized dataset for applying deep learning techniques. The Tensorflow library is utilised here to construct a simple deep neural network for classification (multi-layer perceptron). In order to compare the performance of the neural network with other models, a series of ensemble methods and a logistic regression is also applied to examine any change in performance. This analysis is carried out in Python.</p>
<p>Before beginning, first the required libraries are loaded.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#importing libraries

</div>
<div id="exploring-and-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring and Processing</h3>
<p>Before moving forward to building the neural network, first some preprocessing and exploring of the data is carried out. Classes 2,3,4 and 5 are replaced with 0, indicating a singular class representing no seizure activity. This simplifies the data a bit as it is now a simple binary classification problem. However, with this conversion, there is now a severe class imbalance, which is shown below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Initial preprocessing and exploring

#for reproducibility
np.random.seed(1234)

#Load Data
seizure = pd.read_csv(&#39;Epileptic-Seizure-Recognition.csv&#39;)

#remove first column
seizure = seizure.loc[:, ~seizure.columns.str.contains(&#39;^Unnamed&#39;)]

#replace all other classes with 0 to indicate no seizure
seizure.y = seizure.y.replace({2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0})</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#visualizing class imbalance

# sns.countplot(seizure.y, label = &#39;Class Imbalance&#39;)
# plt.title(&#39;Class Imbalance&#39;)
# print(seizure.y.value_counts())</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/Class_Imbalance.png" alt="Class Imbalance Plot" />
<p class="caption">Class Imbalance Plot</p>
</div>
<p>In such a case of imbalanced classes, it is important that there should be some attempt to balance the data, otherwise any performance metrics generated by the models will be highly misleading as the model will be heavily biased towards to the majority class. As there is ample data available, undersampling is a useful technique that can be used here to randomly select observations from the majority class (0) equal to the number of minority class (1) observations. From 11500 original observations, there are now 4600 observations left to build the model on, which is still reasonable, as the number of features is still well below the number of observations.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#create input and output categories for tensorflow
X = seizure.loc[:, seizure.columns != &#39;y&#39;]
y = seizure.loc[:, &#39;y&#39;]

#scale the independent variables and convert output to categorical
X = sklearn.preprocessing.scale(X)
y = to_categorical(y)

#balance classes by random undersampling
undersample = RandomUnderSampler(sampling_strategy = &#39;majority&#39;)
X_under, y_under = undersample.fit_resample(X, y)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="building-the-nn-model-via-tensorflow" class="section level3">
<h3>Building the NN model via Tensorflow</h3>
<p>Having processed the data, it is now time to build the neural network model. Initially, the data is split into training and testing partitions (80/20 split). To reach a reasonable level of depth, 3 hidden layers are used, each with an approximately proportional decrease in the number of neurons available to allow smooth convergence from 178 input nodes to 2 output nodes (representing the 2 classes). Since this is a classification task, the sigmoid activation function is generally preferred for the output layer, and accuracy is used as the performance metric. The number of epochs is set to let the model undergo 100 iterations over the entire dataset.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#train_test split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_under, y_under, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2)

#A deep NN model
model_d = Sequential()
model_d.add(Dense(120, activation = &#39;relu&#39;, input_dim = 178))
model_d.add(Dense(90, activation = &#39;relu&#39;))
model_d.add(Dense(40, activation = &#39;relu&#39;))
model_d.add(Dense(1, activation = &#39;sigmoid&#39;))
model_d.compile(optimizer = &#39;adam&#39;, loss = &#39;binary_crossentropy&#39;,
                metrics = [&#39;accuracy&#39;])
model_d.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs = 100, verbose = 0)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;tensorflow.python.keras.callbacks.History object at 0x000000006176C488&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Once the model is run, the performance over both the training and testing set is noted.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Training set accuracy
scores_d = model_d.evaluate(X_train, Y_train, verbose=False)
print(&quot;Training Accuracy: %.2f%%\n&quot; % (scores_d[1]*100))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Training Accuracy: 100.00%</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#Testing set accuracy
scores_d = model_d.evaluate(X_test, Y_test, verbose=False)
print(&quot;Testing Accuracy: %.2f%%\n&quot; % (scores_d[1]*100))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Testing Accuracy: 95.65%</code></pre>
<p>The training set achieves a spectacular 100% accuracy. However, this may be too good to be true, as overfitting is a possibility. The testing set accuracy confirms this, reaching a lower value of about 95%. This is still a very good result from just a simple model put together. The performance is further emphasised by the ROC curve, which closely resembles that of a perfect model. Perhaps with further hyperparameter tuning, a more detailed and potentially even deeper model can be created to improve accuracy even further.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#ROC curve

# y_test_pred_probs_d = model_d.predict(X_test)
# FPR_d, TPR_d, _ = roc_curve(Y_test, y_test_pred_probs_d)
# plt.plot(FPR_d, TPR_d)

<div id="other-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Other Methods</h3>
<p>Before prematurely deciding that deep neural networks are the greatest thing ever and should be used everywhere all the time, it is worth investigating whether similar results can be achieved with other models. This is because neural networks are generally one of the least interpretable methods used, and while obtaining the highest possible accuracy is a worthy goal, understanding what the model is actually even doing is also important. Good model understanding will enable the right method being used in the right situation, as opposed to blindly plugging in the most complex method.</p>
<p>In order to make this comparison, the PyCaret package is used, as it implements several popular machine learning methods quickly and easily. First, the data is combined to form a single dataframe once again for the package to process.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#combine X_under and y_under into a single array
seizure_arr = np.concatenate([X_under,y_under], axis = 1)

#convert the array back into a data frame
seizure_df = pd.DataFrame(seizure_arr)

#setting original column names
seizure_df.columns = seizure.columns

#had to apparently convert to categorical again for the models to run
seizure_df.y = to_categorical(seizure_df.y)</code></pre>
<p>After some brief preprocessing, the PyCaret package is initialized. Do note that the code at some points is shown with a ’ # ’ symbol preceding each command. This is only done as there are some rendering issues between python plots and R Markdown (on which these reports are made). The ’ # ’ symbol is not necessary if the actual code is being run.</p>
<p>The environment is setup, with a default train-test split of 70/30 (refer to the PyCaret documentation for further details). The two methods being used here are the simple Logistic Regression as a benchmark, and a series of ensemble techniques including Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests. The accuracy results for each method are shown below.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above analysis has two important highlights. Firstly, deep learning techniques are incredibly powerful for use on complex data due to their inherent flexibility. With time as packages such as Tensorflow are being continously developed, implementing neural networks is gradually becoming easier and more efficient. Secondly, it should be noted that just because they are complex, neural networks may not always be the answer, as just like any other model, they have their shortcomings (adversarial machine learning comes to mind). Also, it is highly likely that given a particular use-case, there may be a number of models that provide equally promising results. The decision regarding which model to use therefore depends on the particular situation and goal of the analysis itself.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This analysis involves combining two modelling techniques to predict house prices: clustering and regressions. The data describes real estate valuations in the Xindian Dsitrict, New Tapei City, Taiwan, and was obtained from the following link: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set" class="uri">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set</a>. While the original data file is in the xlsx format, some quick preprocessing was done in Excel (shorten variable names and convert to csv), just to make things more convenient. There are 7 variables, namely:</p>
<p>X1 = transaction date
X2 = house age
X3 = distance to MRT station (meter)
X4 = number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot
X5 = latitude (degrees)
X6 = longitude (degrees)</p>
<p>Y = house price (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping) (target variable)</p>
<p>The clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) is first used to process the geographical variables (latitude and longitude), followed by simple Linear Regression and the MARS model (Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines) being used to predict the variable Y (price). The analysis is carried out in Python.</p>
<p>To begin, the required libraries and the data is loaded.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
from pyearth import Earth
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(&quot;ignore&quot;)

house_price = pd.read_csv(&quot;Real-estate-valuation.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exploring-and-visualizing" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring and Visualizing</h3>
<p>The type for each variable can first be seen below. There are 414 total observations, and all the variables are numeric type.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#variable info
house_price.info()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/house-price-info.png" /></p>
<p>To remove the impact of time and to make the process more simple, the date variable (X1) is removed from the dataset. A quick glimpse at the data and summary statistics is shown below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>house_price = house_price.drop(&quot;X1&quot;, axis = 1) #dropped date variable

#data glimpse
house_price.head()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/house-price-head.png" /></p>
<pre class="python"><code>#summary statistics
house_price.describe()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/house-price-summary.png" /></p>
<p>The summary statistics for X5 and X6 are practically irrelevant, as these are geographical coordinates. The average house price appears to be approximately 380000 New Taiwan Dollar. This is very close to the median value as well, indicating that there is negligible skewness present. The maximum value of 117.5 indicates that there are potentially some outliers present. This can be visualized with the following density plot. The plot shows that there is indeed a very small number of outlier values slightly skewing the data, but this is too minor to have any significant impact on further analysis.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#visualize house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
sns.kdeplot(house_price[&quot;Y &quot;], shade=True)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/price.png" /></p>
<p>To visualize the house age variable, the following boxplot is shown. There aren’t any apparent outliers present in this variable, with all values falling within the quartile ranges of the plot.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#visualize house age
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
sns.boxplot(x = house_price[&quot;X2 &quot;], linewidth=3, notch=True, width = 0.5)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/age.png" /></p>
<p>In contrast to the above boxplot, the plot for the X3 variable (distance to MRT station) shows significant outliers and a very skewed distribution. But this makes sense, since it is unreasonable to expect MRT stations to be uniformly distributed through the district leading to relatively equal distances. So while the distribution is skewed, this is perfectly reasonable and realistic.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#visualize distance to MRT station
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
sns.boxplot(x = house_price[&quot;X3 &quot;], linewidth=3, notch=True, width = 0.5)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/MRT.png" /></p>
<p>To understand the number of convenience stores, a histogram is plotted to show the frequency of the number of convenience stores present in the household radius across the district. There does not appear to be any normal distribution in this case, with either 0 stores or 5 stores being most frequently present.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#visualize distribution of number of convenience stores 
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
sns.distplot(house_price[&quot;X4 &quot;], bins = 10, kde = False)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/stores.png" /></p>

<div id="clustering-coordinates-with-dbscan" class="section level3">
<h3>Clustering Coordinates with DBSCAN</h3>
<p>Having explored majority of the variables, only the geographical coordinates are left. If the coordinates are plotted on a scatter plot, the image will vaguely resemble the actual map area of the district. This plot is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scatter.png" /></p>
<p>The problem here however is that these coordinates cannot be used in their raw form within a regression or any other model as they will be incorrectly assumed to be ordinary numerical values. In order to resolve this problem, clustering is used to identify groups within the data, which can then be used to categorize the coordinates into different sub-regions. This essentially converts the two latitude and longitude variables into a single categorical variable, which the model can then correctly utilize.</p>
<p>The clustering algorithm used here is the DBSCAN model. While the k-means clustering algorithm is perhaps the most common, it doesn’t work well with geographical coordinates as the Euclidean distance measure used by it is unsuitable for such data. However, in this case the very popular DBSCAN model can be used here, while setting its algorithm to ball-tree and its metric to Haversine, which makes it suitable for clustering geographical coordinates. Another advantage of DBSCAN over the k-means is that it does not require an initial k-value, and it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters well. However, the model is very sensitive to the parameters it uses, which must be chosen carefully.</p>
<p>For the coordinates in this data, the model is run on the values to determine the number of clusters it is able to detect. A separate dataframe is created to keep things neat. The epsilon value, which is perhaps the most important parameter, is the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered the neighbour of the other (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html" class="uri">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html</a>). This varies depending on the specific situation. Here 30/6371 is chosen. The value needs to be divided by 6371 as the latitude and longitude values need to be converted into radians for the model to work.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>lat_long = house_price.iloc[:,3:5]
db_clust = DBSCAN(eps = 30/6371, min_samples=5, 
                  algorithm = &quot;ball_tree&quot;, metric = &quot;haversine&quot;).fit(lat_long)
labels = db_clust.labels_

set(labels) #which clusters</code></pre>
<p>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, -1}</p>
<p>The model has grouped the coordinates into 8 different clusters (0-7). -1 is produced to represent all the outliers. Therefore there are a total of 9 different groups. The next step is to fit these clusters to the original coordinates in order to categorize them. A frequency plot of the clusters indicate that majority of the houses fall within cluster zero, which is probably a central and most populated area of the district.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>lat_long_clust = db_clust.fit_predict(lat_long) #fit to lat-long data

plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
sns.distplot(lat_long_clust, bins = 9, kde = False)#frequency count of clusters
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/cluster.png" /></p>
<p>These clusters can now be visualized on the original scatter plot shown earlier to clearly see the groups present.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(lat_long[&quot;X5 &quot;], lat_long[&quot;X6 &quot;], 
            c = lat_long_clust, cmap=&#39;Paired&#39;) #clusters on scatter plot
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/scatter-cluster.png" /></p>
<p>Now that the coordinates have been categorized, a new dataframe can be created where the original coordinate variables are replaced by their respective categorical labels. This is carried out in the code chunk below:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>labels = pd.Categorical(labels, ordered=True) #convert to type categorical

house_price_new = house_price.drop([&#39;X5 &#39;, &#39;X6 &#39;], axis = 1) #new dataframe
house_price_new[&quot;Cluster&quot;] = labels

house_price_new.head()#a glimpse of the new data</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/house-price-new-head.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="regression-modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression Modelling</h3>
<p>Now that the data is completely processed and clean, it is ready to be analysed using the regression models mentioned earlier. This will just be a simple application of the standard Linear Regression model, followed by the MARS model to measure if there is any dramatic improvement in performance. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) are the two metrics used here to assess the accuracy and performance of the model.</p>
<p>First, the data is split into training and testing partitions. A 75/25 split is used here.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>Y = house_price_new[&quot;Y &quot;] #output variable
Y = Y.values.reshape(-1,1) #2 dimensional array 

X = house_price_new.drop(&quot;Y &quot;, axis = 1) #input variables

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.25,
                                                    random_state = 1234) #split</code></pre>
<p>Next, the Linear Regression model is run, followed by the error metrics being noted.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>LR_Model = LinearRegression()
LR_Model.fit(X_train, Y_train) #fit model to training data

Y_pred = LR_Model.predict(X_test) #derive predicted values</code></pre>
<p>MAE value (Linear Regression): 6.51223</p>
<pre class="python"><code>metrics.mean_absolute_error(Y_test,Y_pred) #MAE</code></pre>
<p>RMSE value (Linear Regression): 10.52067</p>
<pre class="python"><code>np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred)) #RMSE</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the MARS model is similarly run to determine if there is any change in performance.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>MARS_model = Earth()
MARS_model.fit(X_train, Y_train) #fit model to training data

Y_pred_MARS = MARS_model.predict(X_test) #derive predicted values</code></pre>
<p>MAE value (MARS): 6.49561</p>
<pre class="python"><code>metrics.mean_absolute_error(Y_test,Y_pred_MARS) #MAE</code></pre>
<p>RMSE value (MARS): 10.38611</p>
<pre class="python"><code>np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred_MARS)) #RMSE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There appears to be a very marginal drop in the error metric values, and thereby an increase in the performance. Depending on the specific purpose, these value may or may not be acceptable. Personally, the error metrics seem to be a bit too high for this specific case of house prices. This can either be improved by using a more complex model (but it may lead to high variance in the bias-variance trade-off). Other than that, better features can be included which may be more relevant in influencing house prices in that region, and more data can also be helpful.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is an exercise in simple text mining. Five different religious and sacred texts are analysed, namely the King James Bible, the Koran, the Book of Meditations, the Gospel of Buddha and the Book of Mormon. The analysis is structured in two segments. First, the text data is processed and some visual analysis is performed, simply to gather a better understanding about these texts. The second segment involves applying a simple clustering algorithim to determine if there are any existing clusters (segments) present within the texts. The aim here is not make any religious or sacred commentary, rather only to apply statistical techniques on some texts that belong to a unique subject area. The data was freely obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tentotheminus9/religious-and-philosophical-texts?select=pg2800.txt" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/tentotheminus9/religious-and-philosophical-texts?select=pg2800.txt</a>, where more details can be found.</p>
<p>Loading the data and required libraries:</p>

<div id="filtering-for-visualizations" class="section level3">
<h3>Filtering (for visualizations)</h3>
<p>As the loaded data is quite large in size, the data will be filtered to improve computational efficiency as much as possible due to limited computing power. 50% of the data is selected from each text.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)

Bible_filter &lt;- sample(Bible, length(Bible) * 0.5) 
Buddha_filter &lt;- sample(Buddha, length(Buddha) * 0.5)
Koran_filter &lt;- sample(Koran, length(Koran) * 0.5) 
Meditations_filter &lt;- sample(Meditations, length(Meditations) * 0.5) 
Mormon_filter &lt;- sample(Mormon, length(Mormon) * 0.5) </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="corpus-and-dtms" class="section level3">
<h3>Corpus and DTMs</h3>
<p>The next step is to transform the loaded text data into document corpuses. A corpus will allow for further edits on the text data, which in this case will be removing numbers, stopwords (for example “at”, “the”, “it” etc), punctuations and white spaces. Also, everything is converted to lower case. After these edits and transformations, each corpus is transformed into a Document Term Matrix (DTM), which creates a large sparse matrix indicating the presence or absence of each word in the texts. This matrix will then further enable any visualisations and analysis. This entire process is carried out in the code chunk below.</p>

<h3>Visualizing</h3>
<p>Having converted the data into the required format, visualizing techniques can be applied on it. As this is text data, the most insightful approach would be to visualize the frequency of words occuring in each of the sacred texts. Two different techniques will be used here; a standard bar chart (interactive) and the more specific WordClouds. As these graphics are fairly self-explanatory, no additional commentary is required. The visualizations are as follows:</p>
<div id="king-james-bible" class="section level4">

<pre class="r"><code>bible_freq &lt;- sort(colSums(as.matrix(bible_dtm)), decreasing = TRUE) #temporary dataframe

<h3>Clustering</h3>
<p>The second phase of this text mining analysis to identify whether there are any naturally occurring clusters (groupings) in the data that can be used to classify the texts into further segments, thus providing further insights. A simple K-means clustering algorithim will be applied here, as it is simpler to interpret than other methods. The main objective here is to simply examine an example of applying an unsupervised learning technique, on the basis of which more advanced techniques can be utilised. Before progressing straight to the algorithim, a slight modification needs to be made to the data. The filtering section has to be altered, as when calculating distance measures required for the clustering algorithim, the sparse martrix produced is exceptionally large and thus the distance calculations take a long time to process (due to limited computing power). To improve efficiency, specfic proportions of the data are filtered, based on the origninal text file size to result in smaller sized sparse matrices (Bible = 0.1, Buddha = 0.5, Koran = 0.4, Meditations = 0.5, Mormon = 0.2). This approach does have its downsides, as will be discussed later. The only reason for this is to reduce the load on the CPU (no GPU was available during this process). The code is exactly the same as it was earlier, and will therefore not be shown.</p>
<p>After collecting the data (again), the next steps towards applying the algorithim were to first remove excessive sparse terms from the DTM. This would further reduce the computing time and power required by the distance function. After this conversion, the DTM is converted to a regular matrix, after which the distance function is applied. Terms with 99.5% sparsity are removed from the set. The code for this is shown below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>meditations_rmsp &lt;- removeSparseTerms(meditations_dtm, 0.995)
bible_rmsp &lt;- removeSparseTerms(bible_dtm, 0.995)
koran_rmsp &lt;- removeSparseTerms(koran_dtm, 0.995)
buddha_rmsp &lt;- removeSparseTerms(buddha_dtm, 0.995)
mormon_rmsp &lt;- removeSparseTerms(mormon_dtm, 0.995)


meditations_m &lt;- as.matrix(meditations_rmsp)
bible_m &lt;- as.matrix(bible_rmsp)
koran_m &lt;- as.matrix(koran_rmsp)
buddha_m &lt;- as.matrix(buddha_rmsp)
mormon_m &lt;- as.matrix(mormon_rmsp)

bible_dist &lt;- dist(bible_m)
koran_dist &lt;- dist(koran_m)
buddha_dist &lt;- dist(buddha_m)
mormon_dist &lt;- dist(mormon_m)</code></pre>
<p>The parameter value to determine when applying a k-means clustering is of course the value of k. However, instead of blindly searching for k values, or applying grid searches that can take too much time to compute, there is a method that first determines how many k values can be used. This is called the Elbow method, where the number of potential k values are plotted against the sum of squared distances (calculated earlier). When an “elbow” is seen in the plot, the number of k’s at that elbow point is determined to be the optimal value of k for applying the algorithim. Therefore, before going forward with the actual algorithim itself, the elbow method is first applied, for each text.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>From the plots shown, there is no distinct elbow seen in either of the texts. This can mean that either there are no clusters present, or that because small proportions of the data have been selected, there is not enough information for the method to detect any clusters. This may be plausible as religious and sacred texts do infact cover numerous themes, and since the filtered data is limited, the method was unable to capture any complete picture. It should be noted however that the elbow method is based on visual interpretation, which is not always the most reliable. It is also possible that the range of k’s selected (1:50) is not enough, but this is unlikely. A final possibility is that maybe the k-means algorithim itself isn’t suitable, and perhaps more advanced techniques such as model based clustering or autoencoders can help capture any highly complex clusters and patterns present in the data.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This analysis is a continuation of the previous post regarding religious and sacred text analysis. In the previous post, a simple exploratory analysis was performed, along with an attempt to use k-means clustering to further understand the data. However, perhaps due to the size and complexity of the data, a suitable value for k could not be found. To take a different approach to clustering, the UMAP algorithim is now going to be used instead to attempt to visualize clusters in the texts (if there are any).</p>
<p>UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is essentially not really a clustering algorithim as it is originally a dimension reduction technique, similar in nature to the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) method. The primary strength of this method is that it is able to take high dimension data and drop it down to 2 or 3 dimensions, enabling it to be easily visualized, and thereby seemingly forming clusters of data along the way. This makes understanding very high dimensional data much more convenient, an example being a large sparse matrix created from text data (as is the case here). Essentially the UMAP and t-SNE methods are very similar to each other. However, with regards to clustering there is a key difference. With the t-SNE, the focus is primarily on local structures, implying that the distance between cluster groups themselves cannot be relied upon. UMAP addresses this issue by accounting for both the local and global cluster structures present in the data. However, the use of UMAP for clustering is a bit controversial, which will be discussed later on.</p>
<p>This analysis will focus on three of the five texts (Meditations, Book of Mormon, Gospel of Buddha). The other two texts are left out due to file size and memory constraints. Python is used for this analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploring-and-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring and Processing</h3>
<p>First, the required packages and libraries are loaded.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Load Packages
import nltk
import re
import pandas as pd
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(&quot;ignore&quot;)
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import umap.umap_ as umap
import umap.plot</code></pre>
<p>The text files themselves are then loaded.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Import Data
meditations = open(&#39;Meditations.txt&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;)
mormon = open(&#39;Book-of-Mormon.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;)
buddha = open(&#39;Gospel-of-Buddha.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;)


meditations_txt = meditations.read()
mormon_txt = mormon.read()
buddha_txt = buddha.read()</code></pre>
<p>In order to clean the text (similar to the previous post), the data is processed so that all characters are in lower case (standardized), any numerical characters are removed, all stop words are removed, and the document is tokenized (split word by word) along with punctuation being removed as well. The tokenization method also removes any special characters present in the text.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Process text data
stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words(&#39;english&#39;))
def remove_stopwords(tokens):
    return [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]

def process_text(text):
    #everything to lower case
    text = text.lower()
    #remove numbers
    text = re.sub(r&#39;\d+&#39;,&#39;&#39;,text)
    #tokenize and remove punctuation
    token = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer(r&#39;\w+&#39;)
    text = token.tokenize(text)
    #remove stop words
    text = remove_stopwords(text)
    #return text
    return text

meditations_txt = process_text(meditations_txt)
mormon_txt = process_text(mormon_txt)
buddha_txt = process_text(buddha_txt)</code></pre>
<p>Just for a quick visual, simple word frequency density plots are shown. More detailed plots can be viewed in the previous post. There is some overlap between the three texts regarding the most frequently used words. This can be an indication that any clustering plots formed for the three texts may be similar to each other.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Frequency Distributions
def freq_plot(text, header):
    med_freq = nltk.FreqDist(text)
    med_freq.plot(30, cumulative = False, title = header)

freq_plot(meditations_txt, &quot;Meditations&quot;)
freq_plot(mormon_txt, &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;)
freq_plot(buddha_txt, &quot;Gospel of Buddha&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/Meditations-Freq.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Mormon-Freq.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Buddha-Freq.png" /></p>
<p>Finally, sparse matrices for each of the three texts are created, upon which UMAP will be applied.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Create Sparse Matrices
def create_matrix(text):
    vect = TfidfVectorizer()
    vect.fit(text)
    text = vect.transform(text)
    return text

meditations_txt = create_matrix(meditations_txt)
mormon_txt = create_matrix(mormon_txt)
buddha_txt = create_matrix(buddha_txt)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="applying-umap" class="section level3">
<h3>Applying UMAP</h3>
<p>As UMAP has been optimized to be used with scikit-learn, applying the algorthim to the sparse matrices is quite simple. Two main parameters are considered here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>metric: this is used to select the distance measuring method, including the standard Euclidean measure. This metric is important as it will significantly impact the visualized result. Here, the Hellinger metric is used. This is based on the example provided within the UMAP documentation itself (<a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sparse.html#a-text-analysis-example" class="uri">https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sparse.html#a-text-analysis-example</a>). Also, since the Hellinger method produces an output of between 0 and 1 (with lower values indicating more similarity), any clusters present can potentially be shown more clearly. However, this is simply an assumption, which can only be confirmed after the plots are developed.</p></li>
<li><p>n_neighbors: this parameter is specific to the UMAP algorithim itself. It allows UMAP to determine whether to focus more on local clusters (lower values) or on the overall global structure of the entire dataset (higher values). For this analysis, a relatively high value of 30 is used for Meditations and the Gospel of Buddha, while a lower value of 15 is used for the Book of Mormon, simply to serve as a comparison. It should be noted that higher n_neighbor values will come at the cost of increased computing time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Having defined these parameters, the model is run, with the plotted results shown below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>Meditations = umap.UMAP(metric = &#39;hellinger&#39;,
                        random_state = 42,
                        n_neighbors = 30).fit(meditations_txt)
umap.plot.points(Meditations, theme = &#39;fire&#39;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/Meditations.png" alt="Meditations" />
<p class="caption">Meditations</p>
</div>
<pre class="python"><code>Buddha = umap.UMAP(metric = &#39;hellinger&#39;, 
                        random_state = 42,
                        n_neighbors = 30).fit(buddha_txt)
umap.plot.points(Buddha, theme = &#39;fire&#39;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/Buddha.png" alt="Gospel of Buddha" />
<p class="caption">Gospel of Buddha</p>
</div>
<pre class="python"><code>Mormon = umap.UMAP(metric = &#39;hellinger&#39;, 
                        random_state = 42).fit(mormon_txt)
umap.plot.points(Mormon, theme = &#39;fire&#39;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/Mormon.png" alt="Book of Mormon" />
<p class="caption">Book of Mormon</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above plots create some interesting visuals about how there may be potential clusters in the texts. All three are quite similar to each other, with a large cluster in the center, and several smaller clusters in orbit of the large cluster. This makes sense as previously mentioned, since there is some similarlity to be expected due to the common words shared between the texts. There are some differences between the size of the large cluster among the three, indicating that perhaps there are potentially more clusters present in the data which may be identified by varying the value for n_neighbours, thus allowing UMAP to analyze the data with varying degrees of depth and detail.</p>
<p>However, the use of UMAP as a clustering mechanism is somewhat controversial due to a couple of concerns. Firstly, the clusters that UMAP will portray are heavily dependent upon the hyperparameters involved, as choosing the value for n_neighbours and the distance metric will significantly impact the visualization. Another concern is that it can potentially create “false tears” in the clusters, implying that the clusters are much more refined than they are in reality. Despite these concerns, UMAP is still quite widely used, as it is an improvement over the previously used t-SNE method, and by implementing just a few steps, highly complex data (linear and non-linear) can be easily visualized and understood.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The following analysis aims to attempt a difficult regression task of predicting the burned area caused by forest fires. The data is based on the north-east region of Portugal, and comprises of meteorological and other data. The link to the data set is <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires" class="uri">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires</a>. This is based on the original work done by Cortez and Morais (2007), where the authors utilised data mining techniques to predict forest fires. A somewhat simpler approach is utlised in this analysis as compared to the original, with similarities in terms of feature engineering and error metrics. The goal is simply to gain an understanding of how regression techniques can be used with data composed of unique characteristics and properties.

<div id="visualizing-and-exploring" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing and Exploring</h3>
<p>To begin exploring, the distribution of the target variable (burned area) is plotted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(forfire, aes(area)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  theme_bw() </code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The histogram of the burned area introduces the first difficult aspect of this analysis. The data is seen to be extremely skewed, with a vast majority of the values being zero or comparatively quite small, and very few outliers. As the number of observations are also not abundant, these aspects may cause problems for the models to accurately predict the exact burned areas if they fall out of the range of the majority. Techniques to correct for skewness will need to applied here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ff_num &lt;- forfire[,-1:-4]
ff_num_m &lt;- melt(ff_num)

ggplot(ff_num_m, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + 
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = &quot;free&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() </code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The boxplots visualize the distributions of all the numeric variables (excluding X, Y, month and day). Similarly skewed distributions can be observed for the independent variables as well, especially for rain, FFMC, and ISI. These variables will also have to be centered and scaled to correct for range disparities and generally make the data more centralized. While mentioning the numeric variables, a correlation plot has been shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corr_fire &lt;- cor(ff_num)
corrplot(corr_fire) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The correlation plot shows some correlation among the numeric independent variables, however it is not too strong so there is nothing in particular to be worried about. An interesting observation is how the correlations are extremely weak with the dependent variable. This can be emphasised in more detail with the following plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggpairs(ff_num, lower = list(continuous = wrap(&quot;smooth&quot;, alpha = 0.3,
                                              size = 0.1))) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Another aspect of the data that can be explored is the relationship between the burned area and the day and month variables. The code below sorts out the data to enable the visualizations that will follow.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>forfiredays &lt;- forfire[,c(-1,-2,-3,-5:-12)] #selecting only the days variable

days &lt;- forfiredays %&gt;%
  group_by(day) %&gt;%
  summarize(totalarea = sum(area)) #total area per day

forfiremonth &lt;- forfire[,c(-1,-2,-4:-12)] #selecting only the month variable

month &lt;- forfiremonth %&gt;%
  group_by(month) %&gt;%
  summarize(totalarea = sum(area)) #total area per month

x &lt;- c(&quot;mon&quot;,&quot;tue&quot;,&quot;wed&quot;,&quot;thu&quot;,&quot;fri&quot;,&quot;sat&quot;,&quot;sun&quot;) #renaming days
y &lt;- c(&quot;jan&quot;,&quot;feb&quot;,&quot;mar&quot;,&quot;apr&quot;,&quot;may&quot;,&quot;jun&quot;,&quot;jul&quot;,&quot;aug&quot;,&quot;sep&quot;,&quot;oct&quot;,&quot;nov&quot;,&quot;dec&quot;) #renaming months

days &lt;- days %&gt;%
  mutate(day = factor(day, levels = x)) %&gt;%
  arrange(day) # in order

month &lt;- month %&gt;%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = y)) %&gt;%
  arrange(month) # in order</code></pre>
<p>Below are the plots visualizing how the total burned area differs between the days and months. The plots show that Saturday has the highest total burned area, and that a significantly large area burned during August and September. This is perhaps due to some of the large outlier values observed in the histogram, indicating a unique event during the specific day/month in which a large area was burned. It’s also interesting how there is apparently no burned area in November.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(month, aes(x = month, y = totalarea)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = totalarea))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(days, aes(x = day, y = totalarea)) +

<div id="splitting-and-feature-engineering-first-iteration" class="section level3">
<h3>Splitting and Feature Engineering (First Iteration)</h3>
<p>Having explored the data in the previous section, it is now time to prepare the data for modelling. As it was seen, the data does have some unique characteristics, which means feature engineering and selection is crucial if accurate predictions are required. In this report, three iterations of the modelling steps are run, each with different feature engineering and selection procedures based on the results from the previous iteration. The common aspect among all three iterations is that the dependent variable is log transformed, and all numeric variables are standardized to a normal distribution (mean = 0, std.deviation = 1). This step is also verified in Cortez and Morais(2007), where the original authors also performed these transformations to assist with the previously highlighted skewness and scaling issues.</p>
<p>The piece of code below prepares the data for the first iteration of modelling. The cross-validation method is also defined, as 10-fold repeated cross validation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>forfire_log &lt;- forfire
forfire_log$area &lt;- log((forfire_log$area) + 1) #plus one because of values being zero

set.seed(12345)

split &lt;- initial_split(forfire_log, prop = 0.8) #an 80-20 train test split
fire_train &lt;- training(split)
fire_test &lt;- testing(split)

fire_recipe &lt;- recipe(area ~ ., data = fire_train)

fire_recipe_step &lt;- fire_recipe %&gt;%
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %&gt;% #normalizing all numeric
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) #dummy encoding all nominal values

fire_recipe_prep &lt;- prep(fire_recipe_step, training = fire_train)

fire_new_train &lt;- bake(fire_recipe_prep, fire_train)
fire_new_test &lt;- bake(fire_recipe_prep, fire_test)


cv &lt;- trainControl(method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;, number = 10, repeats = 10)#defining the cross validation method</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to now run various models on this data and compare the error metrics generated to find the best performing method. For this analysis, five models have been chosen: the Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model, Random Forests (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a Stacked Ensemble model of the RF, KNN and SVM models. The MARS model is a good place to start and develop benchmarks for performance as it is simple yet flexible enough to incorporate different kinds of data. The more complicated models are the RF, KNN, SVM and the Ensemble of the three. From the three, SVM and RF are expected to perform the best, as KNN is generally weak performing in such irregular data. SVM has a good advantage of being able to handle outlier values well, while the RF model aims to improve results by reducing potential correlations between features due to the random nature of tree constructions. No grid searches are being conducted, and only the default parameter settings set by the model itself will be used. This is because the main goal here is not to obtain a final accurate prediction, but rather compare the various iterative stages and find the right direction towards obtaining a highly accurate model. The models are run in the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)

mars_model &lt;- train(
  area ~ .,
  data = fire_new_train,
  method = &quot;earth&quot;,
  metric = &quot;RMSE&quot;,
  trControl = cv
) #MARS (benchmark)

set.seed(1234)

knn_model &lt;- train(
  area ~ ., 
  data = fire_new_train,
  method = &quot;knn&quot;,
  trControl = cv,
  metric = &quot;RMSE&quot;
) #KNN  

set.seed(1234)

rforest_model &lt;- train(
  area ~ .,
  data = fire_new_train,
  method = &quot;rf&quot;,
  trControl = cv,
  metric = &quot;RMSE&quot;
) #RF

set.seed(1234)

svm_model &lt;- train(
  area ~ .,
  data = fire_new_train,
  method = &quot;svmRadial&quot;,
  metric = &quot;RMSE&quot;,
  trControl = cv
) #SVM

set.seed(1234)

stack_model_list &lt;- caretList(
  area ~ ., data = fire_new_train,
  trControl = cv, methodList = c(&quot;knn&quot;, &quot;rf&quot;, &quot;svmRadial&quot;)
)

stack_ensemble &lt;- caretEnsemble(
  stack_model_list,
  metric = &quot;RMSE&quot;,
  trControl = cv
)#Stacked Ensemble Model</code></pre>
<p>Having run the models, the next step is to compare the error metrics. In this case, a different error metric than the usual RMSE is being used, namely the Regression Error Characteristic (REC) curve. The REC curve is a variation of the ROC curve usually used in classification tasks, whereas now as the name suggests, the REC is used for regressions. That advantage of using REC curves is that it provides an easy to interpret metric to evaluate along with a visualization. Similar to using the area under the curve (AUC) for evaluating the ROC, the area over the curve (AOC) is used for evaluating the REC, with the aim of it being as small as possible. The AOCs for all five models are calculated below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mars_exp &lt;- DALEX::explain(mars_model, data = fire_new_train,
                           y = fire_new_train$area)

           &quot;AOC&quot; = c(mars_aoc$score, knn_aoc$score, rf_aoc$score, svm_aoc$score, stack_aoc$score))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       Model       AOC

## 4   svm_aoc 0.6931536
## 5 stack_aoc 0.7138716</code></pre>
<p>From the AOC results for the REC curve, it is apparent that the RF model performs the best out of the 5 models, with the benchmark MARS model performing the worse. The stacked model has also not performed well enough, perhaps due to its result being dragged down by the KNN model. The REC curves for the RF and MARS are plotted for comparison. The curve for the RF is more streamlined along the X axis, where the X axis can be defined as the squared error, and the Y-axis as the cumulative accuracy. It is interesting to note however that the MARS model reaches a high cumulative accuracy at a lower squared error than the RF model.</p>

<h3>Second Iteration - Numeric</h3>
<p>To improve upon the results of the first iteration, the second round of modelling is now going to be run using only the numeric variables. This therefore discards the spatial coordinates (X,Y) and the month and day variables. Discarding the spatial coordinates simplifies the modelling process, and from the earlier exploration it was observed that with the exception of some outliers, the days or the months don’t have any significant impact on the area. Therefore, these 4 variables will be removed and the modelling process will be repeated. The code is exactly the same as the first iteration, with the only change being that the original data frame is replaced with a new dataframe comprising of only the numeric variables. Therefore, the code will not be shown, and only the AOC scores will be displayed. Also, variables that have zero or near zero variance are excluded.</p>
<pre><code>##           Model       AOC
## 1  mars_num_aoc 0.8163642
## 2   knn_num_aoc 0.7685303
## 3    rf_num_aoc 0.4286511
## 4   svm_num_aoc 0.6649593
## 5 stack_num_aoc 0.7602684</code></pre>
<p>It can be seen that the AOC scores for RF and SVM have improved, especially for RF after removing the non-numeric variables, while it has worsened for the other models (the ensemble is still probably being impacted by the KNN). However, the RF model is showing very promising results, so the third iteration will focus on some more feature engineering. The REC plots for the second iteration RF and MARS model are shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rforest_num_resid &lt;- model_residual(rforest_num_exp)
mars_num_resid &lt;- model_residual(mars_num_exp)

plot(rforest_num_resid, type = &quot;rec&quot;) #RF REC</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="third-and-final-iteration---weather" class="section level3">
<h3>Third (and final) Iteration - Weather</h3>
<p>This iteration is based on the existing literature conducted by the original authors. In an effort to improve the accuracy, further feature selection is conducted. This time, only the variables directly related to weather conditions are retained. This leaves only the wind, relative humidity (RH) and the temp variables in the dataset. This is in tandem to the original study that was published (linked at the start), where the authors were able to obtain one their best results using variables only related to the weather. Rain has also been excluded as it is a variable that has zero/near-zero variance. Once again, apart from the difference in variables, the rest of the process is the same, so the AOC scores will be shown directly.</p>
<pre><code>##         Model       AOC
## 1  mars_w_aoc 0.8201215
## 2   knn_w_aoc 0.7353636
## 3    rf_w_aoc 0.4148131
## 4   svm_w_aoc 0.6903912
## 5 stack_w_aoc 0.7772580</code></pre>
<p>The new AOC scores for the third iteration show variable results. The SVM has lost some performance, whereas the KNN has marginally improved. However, the RF model has improved even further, although marginally. This is a good indication that the feature engineering and selection methods applied have worked in improving predictive accuracy for this regression problem. Once again, the REC plots for RF and MARS model are shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rforest_w_resid &lt;- model_residual(rforest_w_exp)
mars_w_resid &lt;- model_residual(mars_w_exp)

plot(rforest_w_resid, type = &quot;rec&quot;) #RF REC</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/Forest-Fires_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(mars_w_resid, type = &quot;rec&quot;) #MARS REC</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above analysis has identified the importance of feature engineering in predictive problems. Given the difficulty of this regression exercise due to the nature and characteristics of the data, a lot of care and consideration needs to be taken during the modelling process, as opposed to blindly throwing models at the data and hoping the computer does its best. By undergoing the iterative process involving feature engineering, a somewhat clear direction in model choice has been reached, with the RF model showing the most promising results. To further improve accuracy, grid searches may be run on the RF model to find the best tuning parameters. Also, other combinations of the features can also be tested, as it is possible that different models will behave differently for various feature combinations.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This time series analysis involves modelling the average monthly temperature in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The data spans across 74 years, and was freely obtained from the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/volpatto/temperature-timeseries-for-some-brazilian-cities?select=station_sao_paulo.csv" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/volpatto/temperature-timeseries-for-some-brazilian-cities?select=station_sao_paulo.csv</a>. The goal of the analysis is to utilise three exponential smoothing models (Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt Method, Holt-Winters (HW) method) and determine which of these three models performs the best for forecasting the monthly average temperature.</p>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Before progressing any further with the analysis, the data needs to be processed. The missing values are denoted as 999.9, which will be replaced by the corresponding monthly mean (i.e. if one January entry is missing, it will be replaced by the mean of all January readings). There are four additional columns at the end of the data that are not required for this analysis and will be removed. Along with this, the data has to be converted from wide to tall format, and finally converted into a time series object for further exploring. The following code chunk performs this processing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SP_temp &lt;- SP_temp[,-14:-18] #removing unecessary variables

SP_temp[SP_temp == 999.90] &lt;- NA #converting 999.9 to NA

for (i in c(2:13)) {
  SP_temp[is.na(SP_temp[,i]), i] &lt;- round(mean(SP_temp[,i],
                                                 na.rm = TRUE), 2) 
}#replacing NA value with monthly (column) mean temperature

SP_temp &lt;- SP_temp %&gt;%
  rename(
    Year = YEAR
  )

SP_temp &lt;- SP_temp %&gt;%
  gather(&quot;Month&quot;, &quot;Temp&quot;, -Year) %&gt;%
  arrange(Year) # convert from wide to tall

numMonth&lt;-function(x) 
  c(jan=01,feb=02,mar=03,apr=04,may=05,jun=06,jul=07,aug=08,
    sep=09,oct=10,nov=11,dec=12)[tolower(x)] #assigning numeric values of each month

SP_temp$Month &lt;- numMonth(SP_temp$Month)

SP_temp &lt;- SP_temp %&gt;%
  unite(Time_p, Year, Month, sep = &quot;-&quot;) #combining month and year in a single column

SP_temp_zoo&lt;- read.zoo(SP_temp, FUN = as.yearmon) #convert to zoo

SP_temp_ts &lt;- zoo_to_ts(SP_temp_zoo) #convert to ts object</code></pre>

<p>The above plot shows no clear pattern or visual about how the monthly temperature progressed. Apart from a reasonable insight of the temperature ranging between 14 to 26 degree Celsius (approximately), nothing else is clear. In such a case, it can be helpful to plot a moving average chart of the data, which gives a smoother picture of how the series progresses by reducing the strength of the oscillations present. A two-sided 12-order moving average (MA) function is used with a window of 12 months on either side.</p>

<p>The plot above shows a more smoothed visual of the series (with 12 months from each side deducted). A slight increase in the average temperature can be seen as the years go by. It’s probably global warming.</p>
<p>A closer look at the data can be provided by a heatmap. There is evidence of a seasonal pattern occurring, with the lowest temperatures observed in the middle of the year, and the highest towards the start and the end.</p>

<p>Finally, the autocorrelation of the average temperature can be visualized using ACF and lag plots. The shape of the ACF plot reflects the seasonality pattern involved, and shows a significant relationship with every half-yearly lag (every 6 months). This is shown by the scatter plots, where there is a strong relationship at lag1, lag6 and lag12.</p>

<p>The importance of seasonality and trend analysis is highlighted when utilising typical time series models as it influences the decision of choosing the correct model to forecast the series. The prevelance of seasonality and trend in the average temperature makes a good case to use exponential smoothing models for forecasting, as these models utilise both these aspects.</p>

<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>To start the modelling phase, training and testing partitions are created. The last 2 years (24 months) are used for testing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SP_temp_part &lt;- ts_split(SP_temp_ts, sample.out = 24)
train &lt;- SP_temp_part$train
test &lt;- SP_temp_part$test</code></pre>
<p>The first model used is the SES model, which due to its simplicity will serve as a benchmark to compare the performance of more advanced models. The SES model does not account for trends and seasonality, and focuses only on forecasting the level of a current time series.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SP_temp_ses &lt;- ses(train, h = 24, initial = &quot;optimal&quot;)
SP_temp_ses$model</code></pre>

<p>With the alpha parameter set to almost 1, the model is behaving almost exactly like a naive model, which is suitable for being a benchmark. The performance of this model on the test set can be seen with the metrics below. The Theil’s U indicates that this model performs slightly worse than a naive model in forecasting the series.</p>

<p>The next model to consider is the Holt method. This method differs from the SES model by including a second smoothing parameter to capture the series trend along with the level, thereby using two parameters to develop forecasts.</p>

<pre><code>## Holt&#39;s method

<p>The initial impression of the Holt method is that it actually performs a bit worse than the SES model, based on the AIC values. The alpha parameter is still exactly the same, with the beta estimate being very small. Perhaps the reason for this is that the trend aspect of the series is not pronounced enough. Comparing the Theil’s U value shows no significant difference between the Holt and SES models performance on the test data.</p>

<p>Zooming in on the forecast plot shows a very slight angle in the forecast line, compared to the completely flat line in the SES model, which indicates that the Holt method has detected a trend pattern, but is still unable to forecast anything meaningful.</p>
<p>The final model to apply here is the Holt-Winters method, which is an improvement on the standard Holt method as it considers the level, trend and the seasonality of a series in the forecasting model. Therefore, in addition to the alpha and beta parameters, there is also a gamma parameter to account for seasonality. To ensure a robust model is produced, hyperparameter tuning via a grid search will also be conducted. First, a shallow grid is developed (for computational efficiency and to narrow down potential values).</p>

<p>Already an improvement can be seen from the previously applied models, with a Theil’s U of less than one, along with lower RMSE and MAPE scores. To attempt to improve this score, a deeper grid search can be run. The range of values is based on the top 10 rows of the grid dataframe from the shallow search. The plot with the range of optimum parameter values is shown below.</p>

<p>As it can be seen from the new plot and the metrics calculated, there is an even further (although small) improvement in the performance and accuracy of the deeper HW model. To finalise this, the forecast plots are shown below. As it can be seen, the deep HW model fits much better than any other model tested, and is reasonably within the confidence levels.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The above case study has utilised the family of exponential smoothing models. The results indicated that the Holt-Winters model performed the best, as it was able to incorporate the trend and seasonality aspects of the series. With additional hyperparameter tuning (assuming there is sufficient time and computing power available), the above models can be refined even further to produce more accurate forecasting. An interesting point to note can be the that exponential smoothing methods can potentially be used with similar time series data (average temperatures) as it can be observed that temperatures in different regions follow a similar pattern of seasonality and trend, the only difference being how hot or cold it might be.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The data was obtained from the following website: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" class="uri">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE</a> The reason the up-to-date monthly US Unemployment rate is chosen is to highlight a very specific aspect of univariate time series analysis, which will be discussed later on.</p>

<p>The analysis is carried out in Python.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Loading the Data</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>#libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

#load data
unemp = pd.read_csv(&quot;UNRATE.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The data comprises of the monthly US Unemployment rate for 866 months (observations) in total. This ranges from January 1948 to August 2020. There is a good amount of historical data present to conduct analysis. The following chart visualizes the progression of this rate through time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Rate-with-time.png" /></p>
<p>As it usually is with economic indicators, the data here shows periods of high and low unemployment one after the other. However, there isn’t any strong seasonal or strictly cyclical pattern present. The intensity of how high or low the rates can go also has no apparent pattern or trend.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p>Before applying the model, the data needs to be processed. Firstly, a 2 dimensional numpy array of the monthly rates is created.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>rate = unemp.iloc[:,1] #select rate column
rate = np.array(rate) #convert to array
rate = rate.reshape(-1,1) #convert to 2-dimensional array</code></pre>
<p>Next, the data is split into different sequences such that the previous 6 time steps (or lagged values) are used as inputs to output the immediate next time step. The inputs are denoted by X and the output by Y.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x1 = rate[0:len(rate)-6]
x2 = rate[1:len(rate)-5]
x3 = rate[2:len(rate)-4]
x4 = rate[3:len(rate)-3]
x5 = rate[4:len(rate)-2]
x6 = rate[5:len(rate)-1]
X = np.concatenate([x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6], axis = 1) #inputs

Y = rate[6:len(rate)] #output</code></pre>
<p>Usually the data is subjected to scaling or normalizing procedures as this is recommended before applying a predictive model. However, in this case it is not really necessary as all the independent values (X) are mostly within a similar range, so this will not severely impact the model.</p>
<p>X then needs to be converted into a 3-dimensional object as this is required by LSTM.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>X = np.reshape(X, (X.shape[0],1,X.shape[1]))</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the inputs and outputs are split into training and testing partitions. The last 12 months (1 year) is being used as the testing partition, to test how well the model will fit on unseen data.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>X_train = X[:854,:,:]
X_test = X[854:,:,:]
Y_train = Y[:854,:]
Y_test = Y[854:,:]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="single-layer-lstm" class="section level3">
<h3>Single Layer LSTM</h3>
<p>From the different neural network models present, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture tends to be preferred when it comes to forecasting time series data. This is because of the structure of a RNN itself. A RNN layer essentially loops over the time steps previously defined. In doing so, it is able to “remember” or “memorize” information with time, which is particularly useful for time series forecasting, as it is able to remember and learn from the past values of the variable to form future predictions. While theoretically this sounds optimal, in practice RNNs aren’t able to memorize information too far back in time due to its loss function exponentially approaching zero (vanishing gradient problem). In the vanishing gradient problem, the model is unable to effectively update its weights, or sometimes even stop training the model altogether.</p>
<p>As an improvement upon the traditional RNN and to counter the vanishing gradient problem, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model exists. To describe it as simply as possible, the LSTM is a variant of the RNN, where the recurrent layer has a slightly different structure than the standard RNN. This different structure enables the LSTM to “remember” much longer term data, making LSTM models more suitable for time series analysis, as it is able to account for information much further back in time.</p>
<p>To forecast US Unemployment rates, two LSTM models are going to be run: A single layer LSTM and a stacked LSTM. A single layer LSTM, as the name suggests, consists of only a single hidden LSTM layer and an output layer. A simple single layer LSTM model is run below, with 20 units being run for 100 epochs. The model is run 4 times, with 4 graphs being plotted to show the difference between actual and predicted values.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Single Layer

model_single = Sequential()
model_single.add(LSTM(20, activation = &#39;relu&#39;, input_shape = (1,6)))
model_single.add(Dense(1))
model_single.compile(optimizer = &#39;adam&#39;, loss = &#39;mse&#39;) #model

model_single.fit(X_train, Y_train,epochs = 100, verbose = 2) #fit on training data

predicted_single = model_single.predict(X_test) #predict on test data

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plt.plot(Y_test, label = &#39;Test Data&#39;)
plt.plot(predicted_single, label = &#39;Single Model&#39;)
plt.legend(loc = &#39;best&#39;)
plt.show() #plot</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/Single-Model-2.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Single-Model-3.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Single-Model-4.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="stacked-lstm" class="section level3">
<h3>Stacked LSTM</h3>
<p>Having run the single layer LSTM model above, now a more robust approach via a stacked LSTM is applied. This is the same as a single layer LSTM, except two or more layers can be used to improve performance. Generally 2 layers in an LSTM is sufficient to improve performance significantly, so only 2 will be used here. Similar to the single layer, 4 different charts are shown here as well.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Stacked LSTM model

model_stacked = Sequential()
model_stacked.add(LSTM(20, activation = &#39;relu&#39;, 
               return_sequences = True, input_shape = (1,6)))
model_stacked.add(LSTM(20, activation= &#39;relu&#39;))
model_stacked.add(Dense(1))
model_stacked.compile(optimizer = &#39;adam&#39;, loss = &#39;mse&#39;) #model

model_stacked.fit(X_train, Y_train,epochs = 100, verbose = 2) #fit on training data

predicted_stack = model_stacked.predict(X_test) #predict on test data

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plt.plot(Y_test, label = &#39;Test Data&#39;)
plt.plot(predicted_stack, label = &#39;Stacked Model&#39;)
plt.legend(loc = &#39;best&#39;)
plt.show() #plot</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/Stack-Model-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Stack-Model-2.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Stack-Model-3.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/Stack-Model-4.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Having run the models and plotting the predicted values, the results show an interesting trend. Up until month 6 from the 12 month total, the model appears to be going hand in hand with the actual values, indicating a small error range and a good accuracy. However, it is at the moment when the extreme change takes place that the models start to fail at being accurate. This is the reason that this specific data was chosen, as due to Covid-19 the US Unemployment rate spiked significantly. This spike, although shown in the predicted values, is not accurately in line with the actual values.</p>
<p>Also, upon careful inspection, it can be clearly seen that the only reason this spike is actually visualized is because the independent variables are all just the lagged values of the target variable, thereby subjecting this entire process to autocorrelation. This may work in certain situations, such as for believers in the efficient market hypothesis who are trying to forecast stock or other asset prices based solely on previous data. However, the US Unemployment rate, being an economic indicator, has nothing to do with the efficient market hypothesis, making forecasting based on lagged values and relying on autocorrelation unsuitable for this specific dataset.</p>
<p>The conclusion here is that although LSTM models are quite powerful and useful, care should be taken as to where they are being applied. In this particular case, had there been additional variables explaining the unemployment rate apart from its own lagged values, the results may have been different and the model could possibly predict such drastic spikes better. But as in this case there are only lagged values, this analysis should not be taken for granted as being accurate or reliable. However, as far as the model itself goes, it seems to have done its job well of understanding the general trend of how the data goes, and perhaps with further hyperparameter tuning and better independent variables, the results may improve further.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The following analysis is performed on data describing various vehicle accidents in Canada during the years 1999-2014. The focus is on how severe the accidents were in terms of fatalities and injuries. The link between the degree of severity and majority of the other given variables (features) is explored through visualizations. A couple of simple machine learning models are also fit to the dataset to explore whether there is any useful potential for being able to predict fatalities based on the provided features.

It should also be noted that all the features are completely categorical in nature (no numerical properties), therefore making this data suitable for classification analysis and modeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaningprocessing" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning/Processing</h3>
<p>Before moving on to the analysis, the data needs to be slightly processed. Firstly, all rows including the labeled missing values are removed as there is no reliable information that can be used for other options such as imputing. However, since the number of rows is already exceeding 5 million, there should not be a significant loss in information from this removal. In fact, once the removal took place the only noticeable loss of information was from there being no data present for pedestrian related accidents. After discounting the missing values, there are a little over 3 million observations left, which is still substantial enough. The unique vehicle and person ID variables are then removed as they serve no real importance for the purpose of this analysis, leaving 20 variables. Finally, all variables are converted to factor type to account for their categorical nature. This is all carried out in the code chunk below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#removing unknown observations

acc_clean &lt;- acc

unknown_vals &lt;- c(&quot;UU&quot;, &quot;XX&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;QQ&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;NN&quot;, &quot;NNNN&quot;, &quot;UUUU&quot;, &quot;XXXX&quot;, &quot;N&quot;)

for (i in 1:22){
  acc_clean &lt;- subset(acc_clean, !  acc_clean[,i] %in% unknown_vals)
} #left with 3,295,339 obs from 22 variables


#removing vehicle and person sequence number variables

acc_clean &lt;- acc_clean[, c(-13, -16)]

#converting to factor

acc_clean$C_YEAR &lt;- as.factor(acc_clean$C_YEAR)
acc_clean$C_SEV &lt;- as.factor(acc_clean$C_SEV)

acc_clean &lt;- acc_clean %&gt;%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
<p>Now that the data is processed, it can be explored. As mentioned previously, the main focus is going to be how most of these variables interact with the total number and severity of the accidents. The charts are maintained to be as simple as possible, without any unnecessary complexity, to convey the insights clearly. Almost all the charts are interactive as well, to help with readability (it may be better to view these on a computer screen than on a phone).</p>
<p>Starting simply, the progression of the number of accidents through the years is shown in tables below. The top table refers to the data from the cleaned dataset, which shows a gradual declining trend in the number of accidents as the years go by. This isn’t really surprising, as with time it is plausible that safety measures in both vehicles and roads would improve, thus leading to lower accident numbers. To confirm this declining trend (and to validate the clean data), the original raw dataset is also used, which too shows a declining trend, albeit with a slightly steeper drop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Number of accidents progression per year (table)
table(acc_clean$C_YEAR) # clean data</code></pre>

<p>The number of accidents varies slightly with each month, but not to a significant degree. The highest number of accidents take place in June, July and August, while the lowest numbers are in February, March and April. This may be due to weather changes during these months, with better weather in the middle of the year.</p>

There is a lot more variation of the number of accidents per hour, with majority of the accidents taking place between 11:00 and 20:00. This is probably due to higher traffic levels during these hours. There is also a minor spike between 08:00 and 09:00, which can be because of the morning commute to work. The level of severity or injury however appears to be consistent with the number of accidents in total, showing little variation.</p>

Examining the relationship between the collision configuration and the severity of the accidents provides some unique insights. The charts show that majority of the severe (fatal) accidents resulted when there was a head-on collision between two vehicles, whereas majority of the non-severe (little to no injury) accidents resulted when there was a rear-end collision between two vehicles.</p>

Before jumping to hasty conclusions that accidents are caused due to clear and sunny days, it should be noted that a large number of accidents taking place during clear and sunny weather is probably because such weather is the most common throughout the year, thus naturally showing a higher number of accidents as well. The table showing the number of accidents by road surface condition shows a similar distribution to the weather condition chart, implying that there may be a correlation or association between these two variables. This will be explored further on.</p>

To clearly show how severity of accidents vary by vehicle type, percentages instead of absolute numbers are used in the below chart. Here it can be seen that the highest percentage of severe accidents took place when the vehicle type was either a road tractor, a purpose built motorhome, a heavy unit truck or motorcycles and mopeds.</p>

Men tend to have more accidents (and a higher percentage of severe accidents) than women, according to the data. This does not automatically imply that men are worse drivers. It could also simply be because there may be more men drivers than women in general, or that more men tend to operate dangerous vehicles than women.</p>

Naturally, the largest spike in the number of accidents is around the age of 17 and 18, which is when people tend to get their new driving license. As age increases, the number of accidents decreases, which can be because of more experience gained while driving, and towards later ages when people tend to drive less and less the older they get. The percentage of severity (class 3 - red) however tends to remain constant throughout all ages, only rising when the age is 80 and above.</p>

The charts below firstly show that most of the people accounted for in this data were in fact the drivers themselves, since the highest number of accidents are shown in the driver seat. However, examining the percentages shows that the highest percentage of fatalities is where either the occupant’s position is unknown, or where the occupant was sitting on someone’s lap. The highest percentage of injuries (class 2- blue) is when the occupant was in an outside compartment, such as the back of a pick-up truck.</p>

While the largest number of accidents coincide with a safety device being used, it is more likely that this is because most people actually use a safety device while traveling. This is why a percentage bar chart is important to show a better picture. It is probably not surprising that the highest percentage of fatalities is where there is no safety being used. The highest number of injuries is for people wearing helmets, but this is because this is directly linked to motorcycle and moped riders, where the risk of injury and fatality is naturally much higher. Also interesting is category 13, which although shows no safety device equipped, is almost equivalent in percentage terms to category 02 (safety device equipped). This is because category 13 includes vehicles such as buses, where it is quite rare to experience any injury or accident at all due to how large it is and the way it operates.</p>

Finally, in an attempt to paint an overall picture of the interaction between the variables, a correlation plot is shown. The year variable is removed to remove any evolutionary impact of time series (and it is not needed for any further analysis from this point). As the variables are not ordinal at all and are all categorical, the Cramer’s V is calculated and plotted to show the strength of association between the variables. The function below was copied from Stackoverflow (the link is provided in the code comments), with some minor changes to fit this specific purpose. Also to be noted is that all chi-square p-values were zero for every combination, implying statistical significance for each value of Cramer’s V. This chart is not interactive.</p>

<p>While majority of the variables have very weak association, there are some strong combinations shown:
(V_TYPE - P_USER, P_USER - P_PSN/SAFE, P_ISEV - C_SEV, C_WTHR - C_RSUR, V_TYPE - P_SAFE)</p>
<p>Many of these are quite obvious, such as the similarity between vehicle type and the road class user. Also, as mentioned earlier, there is a somewhat stronger association between the weather and the road surface condition. A strong association is also between the severity and the medical treatment required, which both more or less provide the same information.</p>
</div>
<div id="classification-of-severity" class="section level3">
<h3>Classification of Severity</h3>
<p>Having explored how severity of accidents is related to majority of the variables, it is now time to briefly investigate whether it is possible to predict accident severity using a classification model. Two simple classification models will be used, the logistic regression, and the generalized linear model with regularization. No manual parameter tuning or highly complex methods are being used here, as the purpose is to only see whether initial results are promising enough to warrant further attempts.</p>
<p>Two things to note before progressing: Firstly, the data is such that there are two potential candidates for the target variable (C_SEV and P_ISEV). C_SEV is chosen as it leads to binary classification, making things relatively simpler to understand. Therefore, P_ISEV is removed (justified by the previous correlation plot as well). Secondly, due to memory constraints, the entire 3 million plus observations could not be used, so only a very minor portion of the data is utilized. While this may not lead to the most true representation of accuracy, it should be sufficient for this specific purpose.</p>
<p>Before jumping into the models, first the target variable itself is examined.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#class imbalance for target variable

table(Severity = acc_corr$C_SEV)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Severity
##       1       2 
##   53890 3241449</code></pre>
<p>As it may have been evident by now, there is a severe class imbalance. Undersampling may be the easiest way to fix this, but the cost of information loss may be too great in this case given the difference between the two classes. Oversampling will also not work for this reason, as it will very likely lead to overfitting (Due to repeated observations). A third option is to use synthetic data generating techniques. The function used here ‘creates a sample of synthetic data by enlarging the features space of minority and majority class examples using a smoothed bootstrap approach’ (paraphrased from the documentation). To simplify, it generates data within the original data using algorithms such that the number of classes is equal, while avoiding the pitfalls of under and overfitting. However, synthetic data generation is a bit of an ethical dilemma, as it revolves around the territory of falsifying data, so it should be used with care and not to make any outrageous or influential claims about the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#ROSE function - (as seen in documentation) creates a sample of synthetic data by
  #enlarging the features space of minority and majority class examples using a
  # smoothed bootstrap approach. 

acc_corr &lt;- acc_corr[,-17]

acc_synth &lt;- ROSE(C_SEV ~ ., data = acc_corr, seed = 1234, N = 3295339)$data

## 8151 8325</code></pre>
<p>The table above shows that the classes are now much more balanced than before, with approximately 16000 total observations being used. The next steps split the data into a 70/30 train-test split, apply a 5-fold standard cross-validation technique to improve accuracy and apply the models. This is carried out in the code chunk below.</p>

<p>Both models seem to be performing very similarly, with the regularized model performing only marginally better. While the accuracy metric shows some promise, the Kappa value of an average of 0.5 for each model shows that the element of chance is quite evident in this case. It may be useful to see how these models perform on the test data using confusion matrices.</p>

<p>The results from the confusion matrices are much more interesting. Here the regularized model appears to be performing much better than the logistic model when applied to the testing data. The accuracy and Kappa values are both higher for the regularized model. While the the logistic model has a higher sensitivity, the specificity is quite low, whereas the regularized model has a much more balanced sensitivity and specificity. Observing the actual values in the matrices themselves shows even more variation. While the logistic model correctly classifies Class 1 more, the regularized model correctly classifies Class 2 more. To provide a more overall point of view on these two models, an ROC curve (along with the AUC value) is useful.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on the ROC curve and the AUC value, the regularized model seems to be the better choice. However, this is only a highly simple attempt to classify the severity of accidents based on some features, that to on a very small portion of the data. The variability within the different metrics of the two models could simply be because given the nature of the data (and how there are class imbalances within the independent variables themselves), the chosen sample size is much too small and the models are unable to find any consistent pattern. Perhaps with more computing power and a larger sample, the results may differ. Also, very basic cross-validation is used as opposed to the more robust repeated cross-validation. This may potentially be a problem as simple cross-validation tends to suffer from higher variance in the bias-variance trade-off, whereas repeated cross-validation manages to lower both bias and variance by being more robust. Perhaps simply using a more complex model like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines can be more useful. At the end of the day, it really depends on the use case and what is specifically required. One could even question how useful being able to successfully predict the severity of accidents really is.</p>

<p>Before moving forward with the visuals, the data needs to be processed a little bit. The column names are slightly changed to look a bit more neat for the visuals, and a new feature called Region is added to group all the countries according to their respective regions. The regions are Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, South America, Central America, The Caribbean, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) and Africa. This is all carried out in the code chunk below.</p>

<p><img src="/posts/WHR-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>As the key variable here is the Score (Which determines the happiness rank), it can be seen that the Score variable shares the highest correlation with GDP per capita, Social Support and Life Expectancy. It is intersting how Generosity and Score have almost no correlation with each other (according to the data). However, in such cases it is important to remember that correlation (or lack thereof) does not imply causation.</p>

<h3>Boxplot to analyse the distribution of different regions</h3>

box </code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/WHR-2019_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The boxplot shows the variation in Score across the different regions. The highest variations are in the Middle East and Europe. A potential reason for this may be due to the large disparity between the very rich and poor countries in both regions. The lowest range of scores are in Africa, and the highest scoring country belongs to the European region. Oceania has the lowest variation as it is only comprised of two countries.</p>

<p>The above grid of bar charts highlights the average value each region obtained across all the features. The Oceania region apparently achieved the highest average scores across all the features, being only surpassed slightly by North America in GDP per capita. However, Oceania only comprises of Australia and New Zealand, thus making it a bit unfair to compare it with other regional averages. Perhaps logically combining Oceania with another region might help paint a better picture of how the scores for each feature are distributed across the regions.</p>

<div id="circular-barplot-of-all-countries-happiness-score-in-order" class="section level3">
<h3>Circular barplot of all countries happiness score, in order</h3>
<p>This is just for the aesthetics. However, there are a couple of issues with this plot. Some of the country labels are a bit distorted on closer inspection. At the time of making this plot, no solution to this text distortion was found. Perhaps it is because plotting a large number of labels artificially in a circle has its difficulties and issues. The other issue is that this same information could have been easily conveyed through a simple ordered bar chart, which would have looked much more neat. Therefore, the important conclusion to draw from here is that just because it looks complex and different doesn’t always mean it is the best. On a more positive note, the circle chart does highlight the regions quite colourfully.</p>
