      <description>IntroductionThe following analysis is a classification problem, where the goal is to try and predict divorce based on a “Divorce Predictors Scale”. The data was developed based on a psychology study named Gottman couples therapy, and was freely obtained via http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set. The link to the original study from which this data emerged is https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/nevsosbilen/issue/46568/549416. The aim here is to utilise the answers by couples to 54 questions regarding their marriage to try and predict whether the marriage is intact or if divorce is imminent.</description>
