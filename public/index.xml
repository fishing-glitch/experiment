      <description>My name is Faizaan (Fazi) Shahid, and I have a strong interest in data science and analytics. I have completed an MSc in Finance and Management and a BSc in Actuarial Science. I have also passed the Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer exam. This website serves as my personal portfolio of data analysis projects, composed from my own ideas and inspiration from other published open-source code.
Each project workflow comprises of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and applying various predictive (machine learning) models.</description>

      <title>Antidepressants in the UK - Exploring Prescription Data</title>
      <link>/posts/antidep/</link>

      <description>IntroductionThis is a simple exploratory analysis about the prescriptions of antidepressants in the UK. The data was freely obtained from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/prescriptions-of-antidepressants, where more information about the specifics can be found.
Notes about the dataBefore progressing further, there are a couple of points that need to be noted about the data:
1). As it is not possible to capture all information perfectly, some data can be missing.</description>

      <title>Art and Machines - Experimenting with GANs</title>

      <description>IntroductionGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the more advanced forms of machine learning/deep learning models present. In short, a GAN is used to analyse a given set of training data in order to synthetically produce “fake” data that is highly similar to the original sample. This is done by using two models in the framework: a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator determines whether a given piece of data is fake or real, and the generator works to generate data that is good enough to fool the discriminator, hence creating plausible (even possibly perfect) synthetic data that would actually seem to be part of the training data.</description>

      <title>Brent Oil Prices - Time Series with ML Models</title>
      <link>/posts/brent-oil/</link>

      <description>IntroductionWhile traditional time series models such as the Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA families are perfectly capable of making sound forecasts, there are some instances where such models are unable to fully capture what the data is portraying. In such cases, especially where the highest predictive power is required and favoured over model interpretability, advanced machine learning methods can be useful. In this analysis, the daily prices of Brent Oil(20th May 1987 - 21st April 2020) are going to be examined.</description>

      <title>Classifying Divorce</title>

      <guid>/posts/divorce/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThe following analysis is a classification problem, where the goal is to try and predict divorce based on a “Divorce Predictors Scale”. The data was developed based on a psychology study named Gottman couples therapy, and was freely obtained via http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set. The link to the original study from which this data emerged is https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/nevsosbilen/issue/46568/549416. The aim here is to utilise the answers by couples to 54 questions regarding their marriage to try and predict whether the marriage is intact or if divorce is imminent.</description>

      <title>Cocaine Trees - Predicting Prices with Random Forests</title>
      <link>/posts/cocaine-prices/</link>

      <guid>/posts/cocaine-prices/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThe following analysis utilises data comprising of cocaine prices available on an online hidden marketplace called Dream Market, available on the deep web. This data was freely obtained at https://www.kaggle.com/everling/cocaine-listings, with further details about the data available in the description. As the title might suggest, the goal of this analysis is attempting to accurately predict the cocaine prices based on the variables provided, utlising the Random Forests (RF) method.</description>

      <title>Computer Prices with Simple Regression</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/computers/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThis analysis involves a simple prediction problem. The dataset has been designed for basic data analysis, and is suitable for applying introductory predictive methods. The goal is to simply gain an understanding into the analytical process using two basic predictive models: Linear Regression and Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).
The dataset contains some information about computers, with the dependant variable in this case being price, and other features including speed, RAM, screen etc.</description>

      <title>Drugs and Memories - The impact of Interaction in Regressions</title>
      <link>/posts/drugs-and-memories/</link>

      <guid>/posts/drugs-and-memories/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThis is a simple analysis examining how variables interacting with each other can impact regression performance. The data set has only nine features, out of which there will be further feature selection, thereby making it easy to understand the effects. The data was freely obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/steveahn/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data. It describes the results of an experiment which observes the effects of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall, while simultaneously including the effect of happy and sad memories.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis project attempts to classify whether a patient is suffering from an epileptic seizure or not based on certain known features. The dataset was freely obtained from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/epileptic-seizure-recognition. To summarise the data, the features comprise of individual data points of an EEG recording, monitoring a subject’s brain activity at different points in time. Further details about the specifications of these variables can be found via the given link.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe purpose of this project is to highlight potential applications of data analysis within the finance industry. When it comes to choosing viable securities to invest in based on a certain criteria, there are different methods that can be used, including fundamental or quantitative analysis. The focus in this project is on a quantitative approach, using the price of 10 different stocks to determine an optimum portfolio that generates required returns based on certain risks.</description>
